        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">It was a joy and a
        surprise to me to hear news after many days from thee, my master and
        my friend. To thee I owe whatever I have of Greek wisdom; for when in
        the old days at the Holy City thou soughtest me for instruction in
        our Law, I learnt more from thee than I could impart to thee. Since I
        last wrote to thee, I have come to this great city, where many of my
        nation dwell, and almost all the most learned of thy tongue are
        congregated. Truly, it would please me much, and mine only son and
        his wife, if thou couldst come and take up thy sojourn among us for a
        while.</span></span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Touching the man Saul
        of Tarsus, of whom thou writest, I know but little. He is well
        instructed in our Law, both written and oral, having received the
        latter from the chief master among those of the past generation,
        Gamaliel by name. Yet he is not of the disciples of Aaron that love
        peace; for when I last heard of him he was among the leaders of a
        riot in which a man was slain. And now I think thereon, I am almost
        certain that the slain man was of the followers of Jesus the
        Nazarene, and this Saul was</span></span></p>

        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">among the bitterest
        against them. And yet thou writest that the same Saul has spoken of
        the Nazarene that he was a god like Apollo, that had come down on
        earth for a while to live his life among men. Truly, men’s minds are
        as the wind that bloweth hither and thither.</span></span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">But as for that Jesus
        of Nazara, I can tell thee much, if not all. For I was at Jerusalem
        all the time he passed for a leader of men up to his shameful death.
        At first I admired him for his greatness of soul and goodness of
        life, but in the end I came to see that he was a danger to our
        nation, and, though unwillingly, I was of those who voted for his
        death in the Council of Twenty-Three. Yet I cannot tell thee all I
        know in the compass of a letter, so I have written it at large for
        thee, and it will be delivered unto thee even with this letter. And
        in my description of events I have been at pains to distinguish
        between what I saw myself and what I heard from others, following in
        this the example of Herodotus of Halicarnassus, who, if he spake rude
        Greek, wrote true history. And so farewell.</span></span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I was crossing one
        morning the Xystus Bridge on my way to the Temple, when I saw issuing
        from the nearest gate a herd of beasts of sacrifice. Fearing that
        something untoward had occurred, I hurried to the gate, and when I
        entered the Court of the Gentiles, I found all in confusion. The
        tables of the money-changers had been overturned, and the men were
        gathering their moneys from the ground. And in the midst I saw one
        with a scourge in his hand. His face was full of wrath and scorn, his
        eyes blazed, and on his left temple stood out a vein all blue,
        throbbing with his passion. He was neither short nor tall, but of
        sturdy figure, and clad in rustic garb.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, as the
        money-changers were escaping from his wrath, one of them ran
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page12">[pg 12]</span><a name="Pg012"
        id="Pg012" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>against a little child that was
        in the court, and it fell screaming. The fellow took no heed, but
        went on his course. But the man with the scourge went to the little
        child and raised it to its feet, and pressed it to his side; the hand
        that rested on the curly head was that of a workman, with broken
        nails, and yet the fingers twitched with the excitement of the man.
        But, looking to his face, I saw that a wonderful change had come over
        it. From rage, it had turned to pity and love; the eyes that had
        flashed scorn on the money-changers now looked down with tenderness
        on the little child. I remember thinking to myself, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“This man cannot say the thing that is not; his face
        bewrayeth him.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meanwhile the
        money-changers and those with them had collected together near the
        gate by which I had entered, and stood there whispering and muttering
        among themselves. All at once they turned towards the man as he was
        soothing the little child, and shouted out together, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Mamzer! Mamzer!</span></span>”</span> which in
        our tongue signifieth one born out of wedlock. Then the man looked up
        from <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page13">[pg 13]</span><a name=
        "Pg013" id="Pg013" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the little child, his
        face once more full of rage, and the blue vein throbbing on his
        temple. He took a step towards the men, and then he stopped. His face
        changed to a look of pity, and the men themselves, in fear and shame,
        slunk away before his look through the gate and were gone.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then he turned
        towards those that had for sale doves as sacrifices for the women and
        the poor. To these he spoke in a tone that was calm and yet full of
        authority, and then I noticed that his voice had the burr of our
        northern peasantry. He said unto them, <span class="tei tei-q">“Take
        these things hence; make not my Father’s house a house of
        merchandise.”</span> And these, too, went away through the gates,
        carrying with them the wicker cages full of doves. Ever since that
        time the doves have been for sale in Hanan’s Bazaar on the Mount of
        Olives.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now I must tell
        thee that at this time there had been much disputing between the
        Pharisees and the Sadducees as to the sale of beasts for sacrifice.
        The Pharisees held that each man might buy such beasts wherever he
        would; but the Sadducees, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page14">[pg
        14]</span><a name="Pg014" id="Pg014" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>being
        mainly priests, or of priestly blood, would have it that the beasts
        of sacrifice could only be purchased from the salesmen duly
        authorized by the High Priest; for they said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Who shall tell that the beasts are according to the Law,
        if they are bought from any chance person?”</span> Yet many thought
        they only did this in order that they might share the profit from the
        sale of the animals. And, indeed, the great riches of the High
        Priests came mainly from this source. When, therefore, I saw the man
        with the scourge getting rid of these sacrificial animals from the
        courts of the Temple, my first thought was that he was of the sect of
        the Pharisees. Yet these are rarely found in the country parts, and
        the man bore no great marks of special piety; his phylacteries were
        not broader than my own; the fringes of his garment were not more
        conspicuous, nor did he seem as one of the fanatics who are so many
        in our land. He had done what he had done in all calmness, and with a
        certain air of authority. My wonder was aroused to think what manner
        of man this could be, who did the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page15">[pg 15]</span><a name="Pg015" id="Pg015" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>work of the Pharisees, and was not one
        himself.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While I thus
        thought, the man turned to a group of men clad in the same rustic
        garb, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Be ye rather approved
        money-changers, holding fast the good and casting forth the
        false;”</span><a id="noteref_1" name="noteref_1" href=
        "#note_1"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a> and,
        after other words, he turned from them and went up the steps leading
        to the Women’s Court.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now thou knowest,
        Aglaophonos, that at the entrance of this court standeth an
        inscription which saith, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Let none of alien
        birth pass within the Temple cloisters: he that transgresses is
        guilty of death.</span></span>”</span> As the man with the scourge
        would enter the Women’s Court, the Roman sentry stopped him, and
        pointed to this inscription with his spear. He shook his head, saying
        in faulty Greek, <span class="tei tei-q">“Jewish I am,”</span> and
        showed the soldier the fringes of his garment after the Jewish
        fashion. Then the sentry drew back, and the man passed through.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thereupon I went
        up to the men to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page16">[pg
        16]</span><a name="Pg016" id="Pg016" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>whom
        the man with the scourge had spoken, and greeted them with the
        greeting of peace.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Peace unto thee, master,”</span> said one of them in the
        same northern accent I had noticed in their leader.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Who is that man,”</span> I said, <span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Jesus of Nazara, in Galilee.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And whose son is he?”</span> I asked.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The man looked at
        his companions ere he answered,—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Of Joseph ben Eli the carpenter, and Miriam his

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And what is his trade?”</span> I continued.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then I took the
        man away from his companions, and out of hearing of the Roman sentry,
        and asked him in a low tone, <span class="tei tei-q">“And who shall
        be the king thereof?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the man

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And, indeed, at
        that moment Jesus came down by the steps he had ascended and beckoned
        to his companions. And as they went towards him I was surprised, and
        at the same time horrified, to see amongst them two persons whom I
        little thought to find in any public place in Jerusalem, still less
        in the courts of the Temple. One was a woman in the yellow veil of a
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">hetæra</span></span>; the other, a mere
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Nathin</span></span> who had no name among men,
        but was called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Dog o’ Dogs</span></span>. These two pressed
        close to Jesus; the woman rushed forward with a sob and raised the
        hem of his garment to her lips, while to the man he spoke some
        friendly words, smiling on him as they walked towards the
        entrance.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I was astonished.
        The man had seemed so careful of the purity of the Temple that he
        would not allow even the necessary arrangements for its service to be
        performed in its precincts, yet he allowed its courts to be defiled
        by the vilest of the vile. Perchance, I thought, he had prevailed
        upon them to perform the vows enjoined by the Law, and cleanse
        themselves of their sin. Or was it that he was <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page19">[pg 19]</span><a name="Pg019" id="Pg019"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ignorant of their characters, being but
        newly come from rural parts? He must, indeed, be different from other
        rabbis, who kept themselves apart from all transgressors against the
        Law till they had repented and done penance.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While I thus
        meditated, I saw the High Priest Hanan, whom ye Hellenes call Annas,
        enter into the court of the Gentiles with his guard. Thou rememberest
        the man, Aglaophonos—how his tyranny extended over all the city. He
        was still called High Priest, though Valerius Gratius, the
        Procurator, had deposed him years before, lest haply he might regain
        the regal power of the Maccabæans. Still, even after his deposition,
        he had sufficient power to get his sons or sons-in-law named High
        Priests. It was one of the latter, Joseph Caiaphas, who at that time
        held the office; yet the people still called Hanan High Priest, and
        he himself wore on high days the bells and pomegranates round his
        tunic as a sign of his dignity. Thou must remember his keen-cut face,
        his nose like an eagle’s, his long white beard, bent neck, and sinewy
        hand. Was it thou or I that first called him <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the Old Vulture”</span>?</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page20">[pg 20]</span><a name="Pg020" id="Pg020" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He had heard of
        the insult to his dignity by the removal, without his orders, of the
        money-changers and others to whom the people paid the fees from which
        he and his made such display in his grand dwelling on the Mount of
        Olives. <span class="tei tei-q">“Where is he? where is he?”</span> he
        cried, as he came bustling up, with neck extended, and looking more
        than ever like a bird of prey. He soon found that the man he sought
        had gone; but he had given his orders, and before I left the court, I
        saw the money-changers reënter and the cattle driven back. I had to
        attend a meeting of the Sanhedrim, for that year I had risen to the
        third and highest bench of disciples who sit under its members when
        they give judgment. Next year I was elected of the Seventy-One myself
        in the section of Israelites. It must, therefore, have been in the
        sixteenth year of Tiberius the Emperor, nearly five-and-twenty years
        agone, that I thus saw for the first time Jesus the Nazarene.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thou canst imagine
        the wonder and excitement in Jerusalem at this bold deed of the
        Nazarene. Not even the oracle of Delphi is regarded with so much
        reverence as our sacred fane, and none in our time had dared to
        interfere with its regulations, which have all the sacredness of our
        traditions. And of these none was regarded by the priestly guardians
        of the Temple as of greater weight for them than the right of sale of
        beasts of sacrifice. It is from this, as I have said, that the
        priestly order gain their wealth, and no more deadly blow could be
        struck at their power than to deprive them of this. Hence had the
        Pharisees protested against this right, but none had hitherto dared
        to carry out the protest in very deed. All the poor and all the pious
        would have been glad if they could buy their offerings to the Lord
        wheresoever they would.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But more than all,
        men of Jerusalem <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page24">[pg
        24]</span><a name="Pg024" id="Pg024" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>were
        amazed at the daring of the Galilæan stranger in opposing the High
        Priest Hanan. This man had been the tyrant of the Temple and of the
        city for the whole span of a generation of men, and no man had dared
        say him nay for all that time. Even the Romans, who had deposed him
        from his position as High Priest, had not dared to interfere with him
        otherwise. Yet had this rude countryman, who had never been seen,
        never been known to set foot in Jerusalem before, dared to strike at
        the root of his power and wealth. Thou canst not wonder that men were
        curious to know what manner of man he might be who had dared this
        great thing, and busy rumor ran through all the bazaars of Jerusalem,
        asking, Who is this Jesus of Nazara? All that I learnt of his kindred
        and early life I learnt at this time, and I here set it forth in
        order.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was natural
        that I should first direct my inquiries as to his birth, for the
        insulting cry of the money-changers still rang in my ears. Thou
        knowest our pride of birth; I learnt from thee to abate it. Every man
        in Israel taketh his place in <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page25">[pg 25]</span><a name="Pg025" id="Pg025" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>the nation according as he is a son of Aaron or
        of Levi, a simple Israelite, or a proselyte that fears the Lord; each
        man knoweth his own and his neighbor’s genealogy. The greatest slur
        upon a man is to accuse him of <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“mixture,”</span> the greatest insult is to call him
        <span class="tei tei-q">“bastard.”</span> Why had the money-changers
        cast this slur upon the Nazarene? Thou and I, Aglaophonos, who boast
        to be citizens of the Kosmos, would not think the worse of him if the
        taunt were true. Yet thou canst understand how great, even if he only
        thought it to be true, would be the influence of such a slur on this
        mans mind and on his career. If in after-days he showed himself so
        careless of the nation’s hopes, may it not have been that he felt
        himself in some way outside the nation?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now I found, upon
        inquiry among the Galilæans settled in Jerusalem, that some such
        scandal had arisen about his birth. There had even been talk that
        Joseph ben Eli would have put away his wife, but for the stern
        penalties which our Law inflicts upon the misdoer. Yet there may have
        been naught but suspicion in the matter, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page26">[pg 26]</span><a name="Pg026" id="Pg026" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>for the two lived together, and Miriam bore
        several children to Joseph after this Jesus. But between him and them
        there was never good will, and I have heard things told of this Jesus
        which seem to show some harshness in his treatment of them, and even
        of his mother. Once when he was told that his mother and brethren
        were without, and would see him, he as it were repudiated them,
        saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Who are my mother and my brothers?
        Whosoever doeth the will of God, the same is my brother and sister
        and mother.”</span> Again, when once his mother came to him and would
        speak to him, he said to her, <span class="tei tei-q">“Woman, what
        have I to do with thee?”</span> The man whom I had seen so tenderly
        thoughtful to a little child could not have spoken thus unless he had
        felt himself placed by some means outside the natural ties of
        men.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of Jesus’
        upbringing I could learn little. When he was at the age of thirteen,
        when each Jewish male child becomes a Son of the Covenant
        (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Bar
        Mitzva</span></span>), and, as we think, takes his sins upon his own
        soul, his parents brought him to Jerusalem. On <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page27">[pg 27]</span><a name="Pg027" id="Pg027"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>this occasion, as some still remember, he
        showed remarkable knowledge of the Law, when, as is customary, they
        read the portion of the Law set down for the Sabbath reading next
        after his birthday, and he was examined in its meaning by the learned
        men present. Yet he fulfilled not this promise of devotion to the Law
        as he grew in years. I cannot learn that he dusted himself with the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“dust of the wise,”</span> as the sages have
        commanded.<a id="noteref_4" name="noteref_4" href=
        "#note_4"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a> Not
        having sat at the feet of any of the holders of tradition, he could
        not pronounce decisions of the Law.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His father brought
        him up to his own trade, that of carpenter. With us manual toil is
        not despised, as among you Hellenes; there is a saying among us,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Whoso bringeth not his son up to a
        handicraft traineth him for a robber.”</span> Jesus was a good and
        capable worker, and devoted himself especially to the making of yokes
        and wheels at Capernaum, where <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page28">[pg 28]</span><a name="Pg028" id="Pg028" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>he had settled, some five hours’ journey from
        his native place. Here he would often read the <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Haphtaroth</span></span>, or prophetical
        lessons, in the synagogue, and explain it after the manner of the
        Hagada.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus he would have
        passed his life, a wheelwright on week-days, a preacher on the
        Sabbath and festivals, but for a strange event that occurred in his
        own family. Among us Jews, none has more honor than the <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Nabi</span></span>, the man who speaks the word
        of wisdom in the name of God. How know we that a man is a Nabi?
        Chiefly by his words, but mainly by his eyes, in which there shines
        the light of prophecy. Now, when Jesus was about thirty years old,
        three or four years before I first saw him, the light of prophecy
        came in the eyes of his cousin, Jochanan ben Zacharia Ha-Cohen. Thou
        knowest, Aglaophonos, that amongst us there is a sect of Essenoi, who
        answer in much to the Pythagoreans among the Hellenes. These Essenoi
        eat no flesh, they dwell not in the cities of men, they perform
        frequent lustrations, nor will they admit any into their community
        until they have been baptized <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page29">[pg 29]</span><a name="Pg029" id="Pg029" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>of them; they care little for the Temple
        service, and in this above all distinguish themselves from either
        Pharisees or Sadducees. Their belief in the angels is strong, and
        they use magic for the healing of sickness.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, this
        Jochanan, the cousin of Jesus, seems to have adopted in many things
        the views of these Essenoi: he separated himself from men, and ate no
        flesh, nor did he go up to the Temple on the three great festivals of
        the year; and above all, when men began to follow after him, he would
        admit none to communion with him till he had baptized them in running
        water, and for this he was called among the folk Jochanan the
        Baptizer. Yet he was not an Essene, for he joined not their
        communion, nor established any distinction of orders among the men
        who came out to him; he was more like unto the prophets of old, who
        taught as individuals new truths about life; and his great teaching
        was this: <span class="tei tei-q">“Repent ye, for the kingdom of
        heaven is at hand.”</span> And men went out to him, asking him in
        what they should repent so as to become worthy of the <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page30">[pg 30]</span><a name="Pg030" id="Pg030"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>kingdom. Above all, those who were
        despised of the people because they did the work of the Romans, by
        being their tax-gatherers or their soldiers, feared the wrath to come
        in the new kingdom which he preached, and asked him in what they
        should alter their ways. But to them he was by no means hard, saying
        only to the tax-gatherers, <span class="tei tei-q">“Act
        justly,”</span> and to the soldiers, <span class="tei tei-q">“Do no
        violence.”</span> To the poor he was tender and merciful, but
        exhorted the rich to divide their possessions with the poor. In this
        way he drew unto him all who were despised of the people, and those
        who were poor and miserable. Thus he attracted the notice of the
        rulers, who feared that he was preparing to rebel against them; for
        they said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Wherefore does this man attract
        to him the discontented and the soldiery?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, when the
        family of Jesus heard that their relative was gaining a name among
        men, they sent to Jesus, asking him to go with them unto his cousin;
        but he, as I have heard, at first refused, saying, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Wherein have I sinned, that I should be baptized of
        Jochanan?”</span> Yet afterwards <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page31">[pg 31]</span><a name="Pg031" id="Pg031" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>he consented unto this, and went out to be
        baptized of his cousin. And when he saw the power for good that
        Jochanan exercised, his spirit was exalted, and he felt that he too
        had within him the same power. Many strange things have I heard of
        what happened to this Jesus when he submitted to be baptized by his
        cousin. And as none but Jesus would have known his feelings on that
        occasion, these reports must have come from him. Among us it is the
        custom that each Jew should select from the Psalms some <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">stichos</span></span> which should serve as the
        motto of his life, and identify him when he appeareth before the
        Angel of Death. Now, it would appear that as Jesus was being baptized
        of Jochanan he heard the Daughter<a id="noteref_5" name="noteref_5"
        href="#note_5"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">5</span></span></a> of the
        Voice of God say to him the <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">stichos</span></span>
        of the psalm, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou art my Son; this day have
        I begotten thee.”</span> Whether this was a protest of his soul
        against the slur cast upon his birth, what man shall say? But
        henceforth he spake of the fatherhood of God as if it had to him a
        deeper sense than to most <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page32">[pg

        Jews, though with us, as I have oft explained to thee, it is the
        central feeling of our faith.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jesus did not
        remain long out in the wilderness with his cousin; he, indeed, early
        recognized his superiority, though he was his master and his teacher.
        For at the first the teaching of Jesus differed but in little from
        the teaching of Jochanan. He summed up his whole aim in the words
        which I had heard his followers use in the Temple: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand;”</span>
        and this he must have learnt from his cousin. So, too, like Jochanan,
        he mingled with the tax-gatherers and the soldiery, and above all
        addressed himself to the poor, and, as I was to see, exhorted the
        rich to distribute their possessions. In all these things he was but
        the follower of his cousin Jochanan. It is no wonder, therefore, that
        when Jesus separated himself from Jochanan, and began to be a teacher
        of men, many left Jochanan and followed after Jesus; and until this
        Jochanan met with a violent end at the hands of the rulers, there was
        in some sort a rivalry if not be<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page33">[pg 33]</span><a name="Pg033" id="Pg033" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>tween the men themselves, at least between the
        followers of Jochanan and of Jesus.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But even from the
        first there was a difference in Jesus’ manner of teaching, if not in
        the teaching itself. He, indeed, did not wait for men to come out to
        him in the wilderness, but returned to the towns and villages around
        the Sea of Galilee. Many of the fishermen left their work to follow
        him, and become, as he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“fishers of
        men.”</span> He preached as before in the synagogues on the words of
        the prophets, but now he commenced to go forth to preach and teach
        among the people in their homes. Yet it was observed that he went not
        only among the rich and powerful, who are used in our country to
        receive all who come at meal-times, but most of all among the poor,
        and those despised of men for their ill life or their degraded
        occupations. Nor did he despise those who know not the Law nor keep
        its commands, but mixed freely with them, thereby incurring the wrath
        of those among us, and there are many, who are eager for the credit
        of the Law. Still, though he lived his life among the low and the
        vile, he practiced none of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page34">[pg
        34]</span><a name="Pg034" id="Pg034" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>their
        ways, nor was aught of low or vile seen in him or those with him. Yet
        he turned against him many who would have been well disposed towards
        him, in that he followed his cousin’s example, and spake kindly to
        the tax-gatherers and to the soldiers, whom the greater part of the
        Jews regard as the enemies of their country.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, as he began
        to live his life among the people, he began to do many signs and
        wonders, like all our great teachers and prophets. In truth, we say,
        how shall a man be accounted a prophet unless he can do wonders?
        Indeed, as Jesus himself said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Why marvel ye
        at the signs? I give unto you an inheritance such as the whole world
        holds not.”</span> And the manner of his wonders was this: if a man
        was afflicted with a demon of madness, he would cause him to fix his
        eyes upon his, and after a while would speak sternly and suddenly to
        the demon within him, who would depart from him, rending his soul.
        So, too, would he do with women who were torn asunder by the demons
        fighting within. To these he would speak calmly after he had fixed
        their eyes, and, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page35">[pg
        35]</span><a name="Pg035" id="Pg035" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>behold, a great calm would come upon them. But
        he used no exorcisms or magic in his healing, nor spake he in the
        name of God, but with the tone of one having authority in himself.
        Hence many thought he had within him a greater Daimon than those
        afflicted men and women whom he healed. Thence it was thought that
        for this reason the demons of madness often returned to those whom he
        had freed for a while with greater violence after he had gone forth
        from the place of their habitation. There was much murmuring against
        him for that he did his healing, not in the name of God, but in his
        own name and his own authority.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet he claimed no
        authority to decide the questions of the Law; though many applied to
        him in difficult cases, these he referred to the learned in the Law,
        saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Do ye as the scribes
        command.”</span> Yet it was complained that he paid no great
        attention to their commands himself, nor for his followers. Nor did
        he rebuke men when he saw them transgressing the Law even in the
        greater transgressions. Thus I have heard it said of him, that once
        with <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page36">[pg 36]</span><a name=
        "Pg036" id="Pg036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>his followers, he met a
        man laboring on the Sabbath day, a sin which, according to the Law,
        was punished with stoning. But all he said unto him was this:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Man, if thou knowest what thou doest,
        blessed art thou; but if thou knowest not, accursed art thou, and a
        transgressor of the Law.”</span><a id="noteref_6" name="noteref_6"
        href="#note_6"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">6</span></span></a> This is,
        indeed, a dark saying. Is each man, then, to choose for himself which
        commands of the Law he shall do, and which not? The fence of the Law,
        which our Sages have built up with such labor and toil, would be
        stricken down at one stroke. Yet perhaps in this he only followed the
        principle of our Sages who have said, <span class="tei tei-q">“The
        Sabbath was made for you, not you for the Sabbath.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such was the
        manner of life of this Jesus up to the time when I first saw him in
        the Temple. Men knew not what to make of him; many regarded him as a
        prophet because of the signs and the wonders which he did; and those
        who were looking forward to the blessed day in which Israel would be
        free again under its own king hoped that he was Elijah come again to
        prepare the way for the new kingdom.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It must have been
        a year after I had first seen Jesus that I saw him again the second
        time in Jerusalem. It fell out in this wise: I was proceeding one
        morning to the meeting of the Sanhedrim, when, as I came near the
        Synagogue of the Galilæans in the Fish-Market, I found a crowd of men
        entering in. I asked one of them what was going forward, and he said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Jesus the Nazarene will expound the
        Law.”</span> So I determined to take the morning service in this
        synagogue rather than with my colleagues in the Temple, and went in,
        the people giving way before me, as was my due as a member of the
        Sanhedrim.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, this
        synagogue of the Galilæans differed in naught from the rest of the
        synagogues of the Jews. It cannot be that thou hast not visited one
        of these when thou wast in the Holy City, but perchance thy memory is
        dim after all these years, and I will in a few words explain to thee
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page40">[pg 40]</span><a name="Pg040"
        id="Pg040" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>its arrangement. In the wall at
        the west end was the cabinet containing the scrolls of the Law, with
        a curtain before it, for this is, as it were, the Holy of Holies of
        the synagogue. The men go up to this, on to the platform before it,
        by three steps. Then comes a vacant space, in the midst of which
        stands a dais, with a reading-desk whereon the Law is read: this we
        call by your Greek name <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">bema</span></span>. Then in the rest of the hall
        sit the folk, arranged in benches one after another, somewhat as in
        your theatres. Now, as I came in, they had said the morning psalms,
        and most of the Eighteen Blessings, and shortly after the reading of
        the Law began. The curtain was drawn aside from the holy ark, the
        scroll of the Law was taken thence, to the singing of psalms unto the
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">bema</span></span>. Then, as is customary, the
        messenger of the congregation summoned first to the reading of the
        Law a Cohen, a descendant of Aaron, one of the priestly caste. And
        after he had read some verses of the Law in the holy tongue, the
        dragoman read its translation into Chaldee, so as to be understanded
        of the unlearned folk, and of the women who <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page41">[pg 41]</span><a name="Pg041" id="Pg041" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>were in the gallery outside the synagogue, and
        separated from it by a grating. Then after the priest came a Levite,
        who also read some verses, and after him an ordinary Israelite. Then
        the messenger of the synagogue called out, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Let Rabbi Joshua ben Joseph arise.”</span> Then Jesus
        the Nazarene went up to the <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">bema</span></span>
        and read his appointed verses, and these were translated as before by
        the dragoman. And after the reading of the Law was concluded, the
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Parnass</span></span>, or president of the
        congregation, requested Jesus to read the <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Haphtara</span></span>, the lesson from the
        prophets; and this he did, using the cantillation with which we chant
        words of Holy Scripture. Yet never heard I one whose voice so
        thrilled me, and brought home to one the import of the great words;
        and this was strange, for his accent was, as I had before noticed,
        that of the Galilæan peasantry, at which we of Jerusalem were wont to
        scoff. Then, after the Law had been returned to the ark with song and
        psalm, Jesus turned round to the people on the <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">bema</span></span>
        and began his discourse. It is near five-and-twenty years since I
        heard him, and much have I for<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page42">[pg 42]</span><a name="Pg042" id="Pg042" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>gotten in that long time. But many of his
        sayings still ring in my ears, and I will here put down, as far as
        possible in order, all that I can remember of the discourse.<a id=

        that plougheth, let him plough in hope; he that thresheth, thresh in
        hope of partaking. Howbeit, he who longs to be rich is like a man who
        drinketh seawater: the more he drinketh the more thirsty he becomes,
        and never leaves off drinking till he perish. Blessed is he who also
        fasts that he may feed the poor: for it is more blessed to give than
        to receive. Yet let thy alms sweat into thy hands until thou know to
        whom thou givest. Where there are pains, thither hastens the

        sons of men, purchase unto yourselves by these transitory things
        which are not yours, what is yours, and shall not pass

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I cannot tell
        thee, Aglaophonos, how deeply this discourse affected me. Just as the
        Hellenes are eager to find each day some new beauty in man or the
        world, or some new truth about the relation of things, so we Hebrews
        rejoice in finding new ideals in the relations of men. Each of our
        Sages prides himself on this—<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page45">[pg
        45]</span><a name="Pg045" id="Pg045" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>that
        he has said some maxim of wisdom that none had thought of before him,
        and so each of them is remembered in the minds of men by one or more
        of his favorite maxims. But it is rare if in a whole lifetime a sage
        sayeth more than one word fit to be treasured up among men. Yet was
        this man Jesus dropping pearls of wisdom from his mouth in prodigal
        profusion. As each memorable word fell from his lips, a murmur of
        delighted surprise passed round the synagogue, and each man looked to
        his neighbor with brightened eyes. Some of the thoughts, indeed, I
        had heard from other of our Sages, but never in so pointed a form,
        surely never in such profusion from a single sage.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And if what was
        said delighted us, the manner in which it was said entranced us still
        more. The voice of the speaker answered to the thoughts he expressed,
        as the Kinnor of David, according to our Sages, turned the wind into
        music. When he spoke of love, his voice was as the cooing dove; when
        he denounced the oppressor, it clanged like a silver trumpet.
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page46">[pg 46]</span><a name="Pg046"
        id="Pg046" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Indeed, his whole countenance
        and bearing changed in like manner, so that every word he uttered
        seemed to be the outcome of his whole being.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But most of all
        was it the vividness of his eyes that impressed his words upon us. I
        had seen them flashing with scorn in the Temple, I now saw them
        melting with tenderness in the synagogue; and there was this of
        strange in them, that they seemed to speak other and deeper words. As
        he gazed upon us, I felt as if all my inmost being was bare to the
        gaze of those eyes. They seemed to know all my secret thoughts and
        sins; and yet I felt not ashamed, for as they saw the sins, so they
        seemed to speak forgiveness of them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What I felt then,
        others felt with me, for, as I afterwards learnt, each man felt the
        same as the eyes of Jesus fell upon him; and most curious it was that
        each man thought as I did, that the eyes of the speaker were upon him
        during the whole of the discourse. I have seen here in Alexandria
        portraits of men painted by your subtlest artists, in which, from
        whatever <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page47">[pg 47]</span><a name=
        "Pg047" id="Pg047" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>place you looked at
        them, the eyes seemed to gaze upon you. So was it with Jesus. Not
        alone did I, who was, as a member of the Sanhedrim, sitting
        immediately before him, feel his eyes pierce to my soul, but all who
        were in that synagogue felt the same. Nor did the effect die away
        after I had left the synagogue; for days and days afterwards,
        whenever I closed my eyes, or gazed for long on the wall, I could see
        the eyes of Jesus, and with it his whole face gazing upon me.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I had left the
        synagogue a little before the others, because a messenger had been
        sent from the Sanhedrim to seek for a member who should make up the
        quorum of Twenty-Three; and this messenger, hearing that a member of
        the Sanhedrim was in the synagogue of the Galilæans, sent in to
        summon me. When the sitting was over, I sought for Jesus again, but
        found that he had left the city. And for a time I neither saw nor
        heard aught more of him, save such rumors as came to the Holy City
        from Galilee. About this time many joined themselves unto him, going
        whithersoever he went. Those, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page48">[pg 48]</span><a name="Pg048" id="Pg048" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>too, who had joined themselves to Jochanan
        passed over to him, for Jochanan had been slain by Herod, whom he had
        rebuked for his wicked living. It was, indeed, said that Herod had
        also captured this Jesus when he found that he was following in the
        footsteps of Jochanan; but this proved to be untrue, and the
        multitude thronged more and more after Jesus, and from this time he
        began to teach them regularly, after the manner of our Sages. Yet he
        did not pronounce decisions of Halacha on questions of our Law;
        indeed, he disclaimed all interference with such questions.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I am not come,”</span> he said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“to take away from the Law of Moses, nor to add to the
        Law of Moses am I come.”</span> Only one saying of his have I heard
        of wherein he said aught at variance with the Torah. When the
        children of a man who had recently died asked him in what way should
        the property be divided, he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Let son
        and daughter inherit alike.”</span> In this, as in other things, he
        was more favorable to the claims of the women than the Law and the
        Sages. For this reason, perhaps, it was that many women followed
        after <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page49">[pg 49]</span><a name=
        "Pg049" id="Pg049" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>him, even joined in
        prayer with him and those with him, against the custom of our nation.
        Hence arose much scandal among the more rigidly pious among us, who
        follow the saying of Joseph ben Jochanan, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Engage not in much converse with women.”</span> But I
        have heard naught of evil that resulted from this free mingling of
        men and women among his followers. Yet Jesus was not against the due
        subordination of women, for he also said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Let the wife be in subordination to her
        husband.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thou must know
        that among us our Sages are of two kinds, the Halachists and the
        Hagadists. The former deal with matters of the Law according to the
        tradition they have received from their teacher; but the latter
        expound the words of the Scripture, and deal with the moral relations
        of man to man. Some of our Sages, indeed, like the great Hillel, who
        died when I was a child, have been equally masters both of the
        Halacha and the Hagada; and in many ways the teaching of Jesus seems
        to have resembled, if it did not follow, that of Hillel. I must tell
        thee <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page50">[pg 50]</span><a name=
        "Pg050" id="Pg050" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>one anecdote about this
        Hillel which is well known amongst us. He was distinguished for his
        evenness of temper, and men would often in sport try to make him lose
        it. A heathen came before him one day, and declared that he would
        become a Jew if only Hillel would tell him the whole Law while he
        stood upon one foot, hoping thereby to irritate Hillel by his
        presumption. But Hillel said only, <span class="tei tei-q">“What thou
        wilt not for thyself, do not to thy neighbor. This is the whole of
        the Law; all the rest is but commentary thereon. Go and
        learn.”</span> Now, among the disciples of Hillel was one who
        compiled for the heathen a summary of the Law in the spirit of
        Hillel; and it seemed to me, from what I heard of Jesus’ teaching,
        that he had learnt much from this summary, which is called
        <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">The Two Ways</span></span>.”</span> I will
        have a copy written out for thee, for it is very short.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, in all the
        teaching of Jesus which I heard of about this time, he seems to have
        expanded, but in no wise modified, the teaching of <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The Two Ways.”</span> Above all, he seems to have warned
        men against <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page51">[pg
        51]</span><a name="Pg051" id="Pg051" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the
        evil feelings within, that lead to sins against the Law, and therein
        differed somewhat from the practice of our Sages, who think that by
        doing the Law and keeping to it rightful feelings shall grow, and
        evil thoughts fly away.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet while in many
        ways Jesus seemed to be of the School of Hillel, in others he cast in
        his lot with the men among us who claim to be especially favored of
        God, because—thou wilt smile, Aglaophonos—because they are poor. Thou
        hast read our Psalms, and knowest with what insistence the poor and
        the righteous, the rich and the wicked, are identified in them. Many
        of our nation have taken this to heart, and as it were pride
        themselves upon their humility, as some of them call themselves
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Ebionim</span></span>, or the Poor; some, the
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Zaddikim</span></span>, or Righteous; some,
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Chasidim</span></span>, or Pious. Thou canst not
        call them a sect, for in a way they include the whole nation. In the
        Eighteen Blessings which form the staple of our daily prayers, the
        Lord is blessed as the Guardian and Refuge of the <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Zaddikim</span></span>. Now, it was chiefly
        among these men, whether they called <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page52">[pg 52]</span><a name="Pg052" id="Pg052" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>themselves <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Ebionim</span></span>, or <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Zaddikim</span></span>, or <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Chasidim</span></span>, that Jesus found his
        chief adherents, though he seems to give his preference to the
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Ebionim</span></span>, who have always been
        insisting upon the blessedness of the poor. Now, these men consider
        themselves to be beyond all others the servants of the Lord, and
        identify themselves with that picture of the servant which has been
        given by the Prophet Esaias. Thus in all these ways Jesus appealed to
        the more earnest part of our nation, and in him were conjoined most
        of the movements that had touched us most deeply. If any had said at
        this time, <span class="tei tei-q">“Jesus the Nazarene is a follower
        of Jochanan the Baptizer, and preaches <span class="tei tei-q">‘The
        Two Ways’</span> to the Poor,”</span> none could have gainsaid
        him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet all were
        wondering what he would say to the other side of our nation’s hopes.
        The life of our nation had begun with a deliverance; our chief
        national feast recalls that deliverance from Egypt to us every year
        as the spring comes round. We have become subject to all the great
        kingdoms that have grown up round us, yet again and again we have
        been delivered from each. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page53">[pg

        and I have often wondered how it has come about that both Hellenes
        and Hebrews, who feel ourselves in different ways higher than these
        stolid Romans who rule us, have yet become subject to them. Thy
        nation hath acquiesced in their rule; my people never will. Every man
        who promises greatness among us is hoped for as the Deliverer. Many
        men about this time began to ask, Will Jesus the Nazarene be the
        Deliverer?</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page54">[pg

        many months after I had heard him discourse in the Galilæan synagogue
        that I again saw Jesus the Nazarene. We in Jerusalem had our own
        concerns to think of.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this time the
        long monopoly of rule by the Sadducees was gradually being broken. Of
        the three divisions of the Sanhedrim, that of the ordinary Israelites
        had become almost entirely composed of the Pharisees; I myself had
        been elected as one of that party, and even in the other two sections
        of the Priests and of the Levites, many, especially among the latter,
        held with the Pharisees. Nor was this without influence upon the
        political issues of the times. The Sadducees, being the sacerdotal
        party, had no cause why they should be dissatisfied with the position
        they held in the State under the Romans; but we of the Pharisees felt
        far otherwise about the national hopes for deliverance. <span class=

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Since my days the influence of the
        Pharisees has become predominant in the nation, and I foresee that
        the struggle between us and the Romans cannot be delayed for long. At
        the time of which I am writing, the hegemony had not yet passed over
        to the Pharisees, and it was of import for us all to know whether any
        man of influence was on our side, or on that of the Sadducees, or
        whether he cared for neither, and cast in his lot with the smaller
        sects.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, it happened
        about this time that I was attending my place in the Sanhedrim of
        Israelites, to judge of a case of adultery. But in this matter our
        Sages, and especially those of the Pharisaic tradition, had made
        great changes in the Law as laid down for us by Moses; for he, as
        thou knowest, commands that a woman taken in adultery shall be stoned
        to death. Now, for a long time among us there has been an increasing
        horror of inflicting the death penalty. If a Sanhedrim inflicts
        capital punishment more than once in seven years, it is called a
        Sanhedrim of murderers. Yet the Law of Moses de<span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page67">[pg 67]</span><a name="Pg067" id="Pg067"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>clared that whosoever was guilty of
        adultery would be put to death. What, then, was to be done? It is
        against the principle of justice that any should be punished for an
        offence of which he is ignorant. Hence, in capital offences, our
        Sages, to mercy inclined, have laid it down that a man must be
        assumed to be ignorant of the guilt of the offence, unless it be
        proved that he had been solemnly warned of its gravity; and in our
        Law proof can only be given by two simultaneous witnesses. Hence it
        is impossible to obtain conviction for a woman who hath committed
        adultery, unless proof is given that she hath been previously warned
        by two persons at once. This can scarcely ever be. No Jewish woman in
        my time has ever been stoned as the Law commands for this sin. Some
        think that this is too great a leniency, and of evil result for the
        morality of the folk.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When I arrived at
        the hall of polished stones near the Temple, in which the Sanhedrim
        holds its sittings, the trial had nearly come to a conclusion. The
        inquiry had been made if any two credible wit<span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page68">[pg 68]</span><a name="Pg068" id="Pg068" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>nesses had given the woman the preliminary
        caution, and none answering to the call, it remained only for the
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Ab
        Beth Din</span></span>, the president of the court, to dismiss the
        prisoner with the words of caution and advice which are customary on
        such occasions: <span class="tei tei-q">“My daughter, perhaps thou
        wert led into sin by too much wine, or by thoughtlessness, or perhaps
        by thy youth; perchance it was mixing in crowds, or wicked companions
        that led thee to sin: go, and for the sake of the great Name, do not
        bring it to pass that thou must be destroyed by the water of
        jealousy.”</span> And with these words the court was dismissed, and
        several of us were appointed to take the woman to her home, and
        induce the man, her husband, to take her to him once again. Now, as
        we were passing through the courts of the Temple, we saw Jesus the
        Nazarene in one of the smaller courts, seated, teaching the people,
        some of whom sat at his feet. But it seemed to some of us a favorable
        opportunity to test what he would say as regards the Law of Moses
        relating to adultery: for if he would declare that the Law must be
        carried out in all its <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page69">[pg
        69]</span><a name="Pg069" id="Pg069" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>rigor, that would show that our Sages were more
        merciful than he; if, on the other hand, he adopted the opinion of
        our Sages, that would in so far commit him to support their attitude
        towards the Law in general. In any case, it seemed a suitable
        occasion to test his power of dealing with the Law, and it is
        customary among us to put such test cases before the younger
        Sages.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We therefore
        turned aside and entered into the smaller court, and all rose to do
        honor to the Sanhedrim. Then one of us said to him, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Rabbi, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very
        act. Now, Moses in the Law hath commanded that such should be stoned:
        what sayest thou?”</span> Now, when the man told him that the woman
        had been taken in the very act of adultery, a deep blush passed over
        his face, and he turned his eyes downwards. Then he bent down to the
        ground, hiding his face altogether from us, and writing, as it were,
        something on the sand of the floor. Now, at first, I thought of the
        cry of the money-changers that I had heard, and felt ashamed in my
        soul that such a question should be brought before this man, of all
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page70">[pg 70]</span><a name="Pg070"
        id="Pg070" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>men: for our Sages have said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“The greatest of sins is this—to bring a
        blush upon thy neighbor’s face in public.”</span> But the others
        thought not of this, but once more they asked him, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Rabbi, what sayest thou shall be done in this
        case?”</span> Then, without raising his head, Jesus said in a low
        tone, <span class="tei tei-q">“Let him among you that is without sin
        cast the first stone.”</span> Then we saw that his shame had been for
        us, and for our want of feeling in putting such a question in the
        very presence of her who had sinned. And in this matter we hold that
        sin can be in thought as well as in act, and which of us could say
        that we were without sin even in thought? So, in very shame, we
        turned and went, and left Jesus alone with the woman.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet, after we had
        come away from him, Matathias ben Meshullam said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“That is well,—we are rightly rebuked; but yet, dost thou
        not see that this man hath not answered our question, nor do we know,
        as we wished, what attitude he takes towards the carrying out of the
        Law? I hear that each morning he preaches to the people in the
        Temple. Let us now tomorrow <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page71">[pg
        71]</span><a name="Pg071" id="Pg071" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>put
        such questions to him that he cannot evade, and find out to which of
        our parties he belongs; for this is a man that is getting great
        weight with the people, and it imports us to know where he stands
        with regard to us.”</span> So it was determined among us that the
        next morning a Sadducee and a Pharisee should put to him queries
        which should determine what views he held on the great questions
        which distinguished the two great parties of the State.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But that very
        afternoon I was to learn that this Jesus had to deal with questions
        with which none of our parties concerned themselves. For, as I was
        coming near to Gethsemane, I met Jesus with a band of men and women
        going out towards Bethany, and I passed them with the salutation of
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Peace.”</span> But as I passed, a young man
        whom I knew, that had recently come into great possessions upon the
        death of his father, came up and asked, <span class="tei tei-q">“Who
        is that man whom thou hast just greeted?”</span> and I said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Jesus the Nazarene.”</span> Then, suddenly,
        he set off running to catch them up, and being curious, I turned and
        fol<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page72">[pg 72]</span><a name="Pg072"
        id="Pg072" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>lowed him. When I reached them
        I found the young man kneeling before Jesus, gazing up to him, and he
        said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Good Master, I have inherited great
        possessions; what shall I do that I may inherit the life
        everlasting?”</span> Jesus said to him, <span class="tei tei-q">“Call
        not me <span class="tei tei-q">‘Good;’</span> none is good but the
        One. If thou wouldest enter into life, do the commandments.”</span>
        The young man asked, <span class="tei tei-q">“Which?”</span> Jesus
        said, using the doctrine of <span class="tei tei-q">“The Two
        Ways,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Do not kill, do not commit
        adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness, do not defraud,
        honor thy father and thy mother, and love thy neighbor as
        thyself.”</span> Then the young man said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack
        I yet?”</span> Then Jesus said, <span class="tei tei-q">“One thing
        thou lackest: go thy way, sell all thou hast, and give unto the poor,
        and thou shalt have heavenly treasures: come then and follow
        me.”</span> The young man began to scratch his head, and seemed in
        doubt. Then Jesus said unto him, <span class="tei tei-q">“How is it
        thou canst say, <span class="tei tei-q">‘I have done the Law and the
        Prophets,’</span> since it is written in the Law, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself’</span>? Behold,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page73">[pg 73]</span><a name="Pg073"
        id="Pg073" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>many of thy brothers, sons of
        Abraham, are clothed but in dung, and die for hunger, while thy house
        is full of many goods, and there goeth not forth aught from it unto
        them.”</span> But the young man rose, and went away in sorrow and
        confusion. Then Jesus looked round upon those who were there, and
        said, <span class="tei tei-q">“How hard it is for them that trust in
        riches to enter into the kingdom of God! It is easier for an elephant
        to go through a needle’s eye, as the saying is, than for a rich man
        to enter into the kingdom of God.”</span> Then a murmur arose among
        all those present, and they began to move on, and I left them. And I
        said to myself, <span class="tei tei-q">“This man is neither
        Pharisee, nor Sadducee, nor Herodian; these be the thoughts of the
        Ebionim.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page74">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, on the
        morrow, many of us who had agreed together to test the opinions of
        this Jesus went to the Temple and found Jesus walking in the
        corridors. Then he that was of most authority among us said unto
        Jesus, <span class="tei tei-q">“Rabbi, we would ask certain questions
        of thee;”</span> and Jesus answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“Ask,
        and it shall be answered unto thee.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thou must know
        that among us Jews there be two chief schools of thought, or rather
        thou mightest say, parties of the State. The one holds with the High
        Priest and the rulers, and is mainly made up of those whom ye
        Hellenes call the Best, and their retainers. These be known as the
        Sadducees, for their leaders are mainly of the family of the High
        Priest Sadduk. Now, the other party is in some sort the party of the
        Demos, in that they seek to lessen the power of the High Priests and
        their families. But with us, as thou knowest, all things turn upon
        reli<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page78">[pg 78]</span><a name=
        "Pg078" id="Pg078" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>gion, and this second
        party differ chiefly from the Sadducees, for that they are more in
        earnest with the matters of the Law, and chiefly they fear the
        influence of thy nation, Aglaophonos, in drawing the Israelite away
        from the Law. Therefore have they increased precept upon precept, so
        as to make, as they say, a fence round the Law. And as they would
        separate themselves from the heathen by this fence, they call
        themselves Pharisees, that is, Separatists.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, it was nowise
        easy to learn whether a man was of the one party or the other. For he
        might be eager for the Law, and so be Pharisaic in color, and yet
        approve of the dominion of the priests, and thus be a Sadducee. Yet
        in one chief matter of thought they went asunder contrariwise, and
        that was concerning the resurrection of the dead. Now, with regard to
        that, the Sadducees held that naught was said in the Law of Moses,
        and therefore no son of Israel need concern himself with it. But the
        Pharisees, on the other hand, laid great weight upon this. So here
        was a touchstone by which to learn whether this Jesus <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page79">[pg 79]</span><a name="Pg079" id="Pg079"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>followed the one or the other of the two
        great divisions of our nation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then, as was
        agreed upon, Kamithos the Sadducee came forward to ask him the
        question which should determine whether he held with them that there
        was no resurrection from the dead, or with the rest of the nation. He
        said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Rabbi, it is written in the Torah, if
        brethren dwell together, and one of them die and have no son, the
        wife of the dead one shall not marry without, unto a stranger; her
        husband’s brother shall take her to him to wife, and raise up seed
        unto his brother. Suppose, now, there are seven brethren, and the
        first takes a wife, and dying leaves no son; and the second takes
        her, as is our custom, and dies without leaving any seed; and the
        third likewise, and so on, till the whole seven had married her, and
        yet had no son; then the woman dies also: when they shall rise from
        the dead together, whose wife shall she be of them? for all seven had
        her to wife.”</span> And Jesus answered and said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Ye are at fault, and know not the Scriptures, nor the
        power of God; for in the resurrection they neither <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page80">[pg 80]</span><a name="Pg080" id="Pg080"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>marry, nor are given in marriage, but are
        even as the angels which are in heaven. And as an indication from
        Scripture that the dead rise, is it not written in the book of Moses,
        when God spake to him from the bush, saying, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the
        God of Jacob’</span>? He is not the God of the dead, but the God of
        the living: therefore are ye in error.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And we were
        surprised at the subtlety of the man; and chiefly men marvelled at
        the wisdom of this man in finding what we call a support, that is, a
        text of Scripture on which to hang the doctrine of the life after
        death, which many believe to have grown up among us since the sacred
        Scriptures were written: for in them little, if anything, was said of
        the world to come. Now, Jesus in his answer had happened upon a text
        which said that Abraham and Isaac and Jacob were living when they
        were dead to this world, and the people marvelled greatly
        thereat.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, it had been
        agreed upon, that after the Sadducees had asked their question and
        been answered, I should stand <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page81">[pg 81]</span><a name="Pg081" id="Pg081" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>forth and test this man Jesus on behalf of the
        Pharisees. Now, one of our Sages hath said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Be as careful of a little precept as of a great
        one;”</span> whereas our great master Hillel had, as I have told
        thee, summed up the whole Law in one precept, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Love thy neighbor as thyself.”</span> Therefore, we of
        the Pharisees wished to know whether this Jesus agreed with the one
        sage or the other; so I spake unto him and said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Rabbi, which is the first commandment, by doing which I
        shall inherit the life everlasting?”</span> But at first he answered
        me not directly, but said, <span class="tei tei-q">“How readest
        thou?”</span> Then I remembered me the words of the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Catechism of the Two Ways,”</span> and answered,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all
        thy heart, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind, and thy
        neighbor as thyself: whatsoever thou wouldest not for thyself, do not
        to another.”</span> And he said unto me, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Thou hast answered right; and the first of the
        commandments is the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Shema</span></span>: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Hear, O Israel; the Lord thy God is one God.’</span> And
        the second is like, namely this: <span class="tei tei-q">‘Thou shalt
        love thy neighbor as <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page82">[pg
        82]</span><a name="Pg082" id="Pg082" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>thyself.’</span> There is none other commandment
        greater than these. This do, and thou shalt live.”</span> Then I was
        rejoiced, and said unto him, <span class="tei tei-q">“Well, Rabbi,
        thou hast said the truth: there is one God, and there is none other
        but him; and to love him with all the heart, and with all the
        understanding, and with all the soul, and all the strength, and to
        love one’s neighbor as one’s self, is more than all the burnt
        offerings and sacrifices.”</span> Then Jesus became gracious unto me,
        and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou art not far from the kingdom
        of God.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But then I would
        learn further from this man who spake so well, and ask him the
        question which is current in our schools on this subject, and I said
        to him, <span class="tei tei-q">“But, Rabbi, who is my
        neighbor?”</span> and he answered with a <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">mashal</span></span>, or parable, and said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“To what is the matter like? A certain man
        was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho; and he fell among robbers,
        which both stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half
        dead. And by chance a certain priest was going down that way: and
        when he saw him, he passed by on the other side. And in like
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page83">[pg 83]</span><a name="Pg083"
        id="Pg083" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>manner a Levite also, when he
        came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side. But a
        certain Israelite,<a id="noteref_8" name="noteref_8" href=
        "#note_8"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">8</span></span></a> as he
        journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he was moved with
        compassion, and came to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on them
        oil and wine; and he set him on his own beast, and brought him to an
        inn, and took care of him. And on the morrow he took out two pence,
        and gave them to the host, and said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Take
        care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, I, when I come back
        again, will repay thee.’</span> Which of these three, thinkest thou,
        proved neighbor unto him that fell among the robbers?”</span> Then I
        said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Not the priest, nor the Levite, though
        they held office in Israel, but the simple Israelite who showed mercy
        upon him.”</span> Then Jesus said unto me, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Go and do thou likewise;”</span> and at this moment we
        were all summoned to the mid-day sacrifice in the Temple.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When Jesus had
        departed, after the sacrifice, we all met together and discussed his
        answers, which had stamped him in <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page84">[pg 84]</span><a name="Pg084" id="Pg084" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>our minds as a master in the art of question and
        answer, which is with us as favorable a trial of skill as oratory or
        poetry with you Hellenes. Now, as regards the question of the
        Sadducees, men thought he had spoken more openly; for though he had
        evaded a direct answer to the question of the seven brothers and
        their wife, he had yet implied that they all would have a part in the
        life to come. Some regretted that the question had not been put
        differently, and the problem set—if a son had been born through the
        seventh brother: for this might have thrown light upon the question
        of the schools, whether the brother’s widow was to be still regarded
        as his wife if seed had been raised to him after his death. But as to
        the support which Jesus had taken from Scripture for the life
        everlasting, though here again he had answered question by question,
        it was decided that he was against the Sadducees on this point.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But on the
        questions which I had put to him, all had agreed that he had answered
        as a Pharisee, even as Hillel might have answered, for he had
        yea-said the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page85">[pg
        85]</span><a name="Pg085" id="Pg085" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>doctrine which I had cited from the beginning of
        <span class="tei tei-q">“The Two Ways”</span> in which the doctrine
        of Hillel is summed up; and even as to my further question, as to who
        is the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">chaber</span></span>, or neighbor, though
        opinions were divided, most thought that he had spoken as a Pharisee
        might have spoken: for thou knowest, Aglaophonos, that our nation is
        divided into three great classes—the <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Cohanim</span></span>, or Priests; the Levites;
        and the common Israelites. Now, of these, the two former are the
        officials of the Temple, and most if not all of the Sadducees are
        from this class. And, in declaring himself on the side of the third
        class of simple Israelites, Jesus had, we all thought, declared
        himself on the side of the Pharisees.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I cannot clearly
        remember at what season of the year it was that I next saw Jesus;
        indeed, I am surprised to think that, after the lapse of nearly
        five-and-twenty years, I can still remember almost all that passed on
        the various occasions when I was in his presence. Yet I think it was
        about the time of the feast which we hold in memory of the
        rededication of the Temple under the Maccabæans that I again saw and
        heard the Galilæan stranger; for I mind me that I had just been
        taking the eight-branch candlestick which we use in the ceremonials
        of this feast to Petachayah the silversmith to be mended, when on my
        return I saw a throng collected round the synagogue of the Galilæans,
        and entering in, found that Jesus was to preach that day. The same
        ceremonial was gone through as I have already described to thee: the
        Law was taken from the ark with rejoicing; priest and Levite
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page90">[pg 90]</span><a name="Pg090"
        id="Pg090" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and four ordinary Israelites
        were summoned to hear it read, and again the crier called,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Let Rabbi Joshua, the son of Rabbi Joseph,
        arise.”</span> Now, it chanced that this time, I, as a member of the
        Sanhedrim, was summoned to the reading of the Law immediately after
        Jesus, and for a time, as is customary, we stood together upon the
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">bema</span></span>. I observed that, as the
        reading of the Law proceeded, the eyes of the Nazarene became fixed
        upon the ark, and a veil of mysterious tenderness seemed to come over
        them, as if he were in communion with the <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Shechinah</span></span>, or Glory, itself. It
        seemed to me that afterwards, when he read the <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Haphtara</span></span> from the prophets, and
        when he preached, something remained in him of this mystical
        communion.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Perhaps it was for
        this that we seemed to miss that sense of individual address which we
        had before observed in his eyes. No longer did these speak to us
        other and deeper thoughts than the words of the preacher; they seemed
        to dream of divine things, and so caused us also to be rapt in mystic
        musings. I cannot on this ac<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page91">[pg
        91]</span><a name="Pg091" id="Pg091" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>count
        recall for you all or even many of the words which he uttered on this
        occasion. He began with some plain teaching about practice. Soon he
        went on to speak of himself in a marvellous way, as if he would imply
        that communion with him and with the Most High were one and the same,
        and then in his last words he seemed to speak of the Last Things. And
        here again his words seemed as if he identified himself with the
        great Judge.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, this is not
        so strange to our mode of thinking in Israel as thou mightest think.
        Almost all our prophets speak the oracles of God as if they were
        using the very words of the Lord. Thou canst read in the Greek
        translation of the Seventy many passages of the prophets in which the
        very words of the Lord are given. Yet in most, if not all, cases the
        prophet beginneth, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thus saith the
        Lord,”</span> or endeth, <span class="tei tei-q">“This is the word of
        the Lord.”</span> But with this Jesus it was otherwise. He spoke as
        the ancient prophets do, but whether from his rapt intentness in the
        message he was delivering, or because he felt his spirit for the time
        merged in the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page92">[pg
        92]</span><a name="Pg092" id="Pg092" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>divine, he spoke as if the message was his. And
        as he spoke, I saw looks of amazement pass between many in the
        synagogue, and one old graybeard rose as if to protest, and then,
        shaking his withered hands above his head, went out of the
        synagogue.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I will here set
        down for thee as many of the words that fell from Jesus’ lips on this
        occasion as I can remember. They are but few, but many of them are
        weighty, and I have told thee above the general lines of thought
        which seemed to run through his discourse; and these are the words as
        far as I remember them.<a id="noteref_9" name="noteref_9" href=

        and possess not anything in this world. For the Father wisheth to be

        Those who wish to see me, and wish to cling to the kingdom, must take
        me through affliction and suffering. For he that is near me is near
        the fire, he that is far from me is far from the kingdom. Where one
        is, there too am I; where twain are, there too will I be. As any of

        you, in that also will I judge you.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Never heard I any
        who spoke of himself as this man did. For days and days afterwards
        some of his words came to me again and again. Whenever I was alone I
        seemed to hear his voice saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Where one
        is, there too am I; where twain are, there too will I be.”</span>
        Whenever I gazed on the running stream or looked on the polished
        steel of the mirror, again I seemed to hear him say, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“As any of you sees himself in the water or in the
        mirror, so let him see me in himself.”</span> And, in truth, at times
        my features seemed to fade away, and the face of Jesus gaze upon
        me.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Others thought not
        as I. When we assembled after the sermon, to talk over it, as is our
        custom, I found that most had been chiefly touched by certain sayings
        at the end of the sermon, in which Jesus <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page95">[pg 95]</span><a name="Pg095" id="Pg095" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>seemed to speak of the future life and the last
        judgment. Thou knowest, Aglaophonos, that with regard to these
        matters I incline more to the teaching of the Sadducean sect, who
        hold that Holy Scripture speaketh not of these things, and that,
        therefore, we need not and should not think thereon. But there were
        few who held that doctrine in the synagogue that day, and these
        thought most of the words in which Jesus seemed to claim the
        prerogatives of the Divine Judge. <span class="tei tei-q">“I was
        amazed,”</span> quoth Serachyah ben Pinchas, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“when he spoke of judging us himself in the last days: it
        wanted but a little that I had rent my garments at the blasphemy. But
        surely, thought I to myself, the man will shortly tell us,
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘These are the words of the Lord,’</span> and
        so I refrained.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now I will tell
        thee of a most strange event that happened with me and this Jesus. A
        day or two after this, I was sitting in my room and studying the
        words of Torah, and had fallen into deep thought on the things of
        this life and the next, and gradually I fell thinking of certain
        words that I had heard from Jesus <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page96">[pg 96]</span><a name="Pg096" id="Pg096" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>the Nazarene, as I have before told you. Hast
        thou ever felt, Aglaophonos, as if some one was gazing upon thee, and
        thou couldst not refrain from looking round to see who it was? So I
        felt at this moment, and I looked up from the sacred scroll, and lo!
        Jesus the Nazarene stood before me, gazing upon me with those
        piercing eyes I can never forget. His face was pale and indistinct,
        but the eyes shone forth as if with tenderness and pity. Then he
        seemed to lean forward, and spoke to me in a low yet piercing voice
        these words: <span class="tei tei-q">“Awake thou that sleepest, and
        arise from the dead, and the Christ shall shine upon thee.”</span> I
        had shrunk back from his gaze, and was, indeed, in all amaze and
        wonder that he should be in the room; but when I looked again,
        behold, he was gone, there was no man there.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But this is not
        all the wonder of that event, for, being startled, and, indeed,
        somewhat fearful at his sudden appearance and disappearance, I arose
        and went out into the highway, and went out to walk on the Gethsemane
        road. Now, as I came clear of the city, I saw a group of <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page97">[pg 97]</span><a name="Pg097" id="Pg097"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>men coming down the opposite hill, and
        when they came near, behold, it was Jesus and some of his friends. I
        was astonished and surprised beyond all measure, for how could Jesus
        have just been with me, and be now coming from Gethsemane? And when
        they were passing me, Jesus glanced at me very slightly, as at a
        stranger—he that had spoken to my soul but a few minutes since.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, after they
        had passed me, there came one running after them whom I knew—one
        Meshullam ben Hanoch—and I stopped him and asked him whither he was
        going, and he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Stay me not. I have run
        all the way from Bethany to catch up that man thou seest there, Jesus
        the Nazarene;”</span> and with that he took up his running and left
        me.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I knew not what to
        think. I had seen and heard Jesus in my own house in Jerusalem, and
        lo! at that very same time, as I now learned, he had been at Bethany.
        What thinkest thou, Aglaophonos,—can a man be in two places at one
        and the same time? or can it be that the mind of man, and the power
        of his eye, can go <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page98">[pg
        98]</span><a name="Pg098" id="Pg098" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>forth
        from his body and create a vision of another man that hath all the
        semblance of reality? I know not what to think; but I have heard
        that, even after his death, those who were nearest and dearest to
        Jesus saw him and heard him even as I did. Nor do I wonder at this,
        after what has occurred to myself.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, it chanced
        that about this time I was invited to a feast at the house of Elisha
        ben Simeon, one of the leaders of the Pharisees in Jerusalem. His son
        had become thirteen years old that week, and, as is our custom, was
        received into the holy congregation as a Son of the Covenant on the
        Sabbath. He had been summoned up to the reading of the Law, and had
        himself read aloud a portion of it; for from this day onward he was
        to be treated in all matters of religion as if he were a man. Being a
        friend of his father, I had attended his synagogue, and heard the
        lad’s pure voice for the first time in his life declare publicly his
        faith in the Most High.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After the service
        in the synagogue, his friends accompanied the father and the lad to
        their house, and with them went I, who had known the father from our
        schoolboy days, and the little lad from the time of his
        birth.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg
        102]</span><a name="Pg102" id="Pg102" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, it chanced
        that, as we came near the door of Elisha’s house, we met Jesus the
        Nazarene, and two or three with him. So Elisha greeted them, and
        invited them courteously to join the feast, as is the custom among
        us. And Jesus and the others assented, and followed into the house
        with us. <span class="tei tei-q">“To table, to table!”</span> cried
        Elisha, pointing to the couches standing round the well-filled
        board.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When we were all
        seated, the host and his son came round with an ewer and basin to
        perform the washing of the hands prescribed by the Law. But when they
        came to the Galilæan strangers, these refused, saying, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“We wash not before meals.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Then we must serve ye last,”</span> said Elisha, with a
        smile. But the others took not the matter so pleasantly; for since we
        have one common dish, which is handed round to the guests for them to
        take their food with their fingers, it is considered gross
        ill-breeding for a man not to perform the ceremony of washing before
        meals.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Elisha took a
        seat at the centre of the table, and said the grace before meals.
        Then he broke bread, and, dip<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page103">[pg 103]</span><a name="Pg103" id="Pg103" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>ping a morsel into salt for each of the guests,
        he called his son to him to carry it round. When he saw that each of
        the guests had a piece of bread dipped in salt, Elisha recited the
        blessing on the bread, <span class="tei tei-q">“Blessed art Thou, O
        Lord our God, who bringest forth bread from the earth,”</span> and
        all said <span class="tei tei-q">“Amen.”</span> And one of the guests
        said to Elisha, <span class="tei tei-q">“I am glad we are not in

        "tei tei-q">“How so, Phineas?”</span> said Elisha to the man, who was
        well known at all feasts at that time in Jerusalem.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And Phineas said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“For there they only eat bread with their
        bread.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Nay, that would not suit thee, Phineas. Thou art no
        Nazarite;”</span> and most of the guests who knew him laughed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Elisha
        clapped his hands, and the slaves took round the first course of
        salted fish; then afterwards the cold baked meats—for, being the
        Sabbath, the food had been prepared the day before.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then one of the
        guests said to one of the Galilæans, <span class="tei tei-q">“Is it
        true that you allow fowl to be boiled in milk in your
        country?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Yes, truly; why not?”</span> said the
        Galilæan.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page104">[pg
        104]</span><a name="Pg104" id="Pg104" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Is it not written thrice in the Law,”</span> said the
        guest, <span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘Thou shalt
        not seethe the kid in its mother’s milk’</span>?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“In our country,”</span> said the Galilæan, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“fowls give no milk.”</span> And we all of us laughed,
        save only Jesus.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Nay, but the Sages have carried their prohibition even
        unto fowls, lest the people be led to confuse flesh and
        flesh.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By this time we
        had arrived at the third and last course of salted olives, lettuces,
        and radishes. And again the bowl and ewer were passed round, and this
        time the Galilæans did not refuse the water. Then the new son of the
        covenant recited in his clear voice the grace after meals. And all
        rose, while the slaves removed the remnants. Then said Elisha,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“It is not well that when so many are
        together we should depart without discussing some words of the Law.
        My little Lazarus here would fain learn some new thing from the many
        learned men present on this day of his being received into
        Israel.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Well, then,”</span> said one of the company,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I should like to put a question to our
        friends here from Galilee.”</span> And they said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Speak, Rabbi.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page105">[pg 105]</span><a name="Pg105" id="Pg105" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And he addressed
        himself to Jesus, and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Why walk not thy
        disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread
        with unwashen hands?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Jesus spoke
        out, and as he spoke he strode up and down the room, with his hand
        clutching the air, and the vein throbbing on his left temple.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Well hath Esaias prophesied of you
        hypocrites, as it is written, <span class="tei tei-q">‘This people
        honoreth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. Howbeit
        in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments
        of men.’</span> ”</span> Then facing us all, he added, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“For ye lay aside the commandment of God, and hold the
        tradition of men.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“How so, master?”</span> said Elisha; <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“prove thy words.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It is said in the Word of God, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Honor thy father and thy mother,’</span> and yet the
        Sages say, <span class="tei tei-q">‘If a man be asked by his father
        or mother to honor them with a gift, and he say, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I vow that thing to the Almighty,”</span> then it is
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Corban</span></span>,’</span> and put aside for
        the Lord, so that his parents cannot enjoy thereof. Thus by your
        tradition about vows ye make the Word of God <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page106">[pg 106]</span><a name="Pg106" id="Pg106" class=

        many like things ye do.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Elisha said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“But the Sages are by no means at one in that
        matter of the vows, and in particular many of them declare all the
        vows annulled that would work against our duty to our parents, or
        even against our love to our neighbor. Yet, even if we take the more
        stricter tradition, in what manner that absolves us from washing our
        hands before meals, I see not.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Nay, it is the same thing,”</span> replied Jesus.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the
        cup and platter, but your inward thoughts are full of ravening and
        wickedness. Ye fools! did not the Holy One, blessed be He, who made
        that which is without, make also that which is within? Therefore give
        for alms that which is within, kindly thoughts and friendly feelings.
        If ye do that, all things are clean unto you.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then I said unto
        Jesus, for this matter touched us scribes nearly, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Master, in speaking thus against tradition thou
        reproachest us also that be scribes.”</span></p><span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page107">[pg 107]</span><a name="Pg107" id="Pg107"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And he answered,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Woe, woe unto ye, scribes! which desire to
        walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the higher
        seats in the synagogues, and the chief places at feasts, which devour
        widows’ houses, and for a show make long prayers.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then an angry
        murmur rose among all the folk there assembled at the harsh words of
        the stranger, when suddenly was heard the voice of Simeon ben
        Lazarus, the father of Elisha, a very old man, who sat in the corner
        and said:—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Young man, fourscore years and two have I lived upon
        this earth; a Pharisee have I been from the day I became a son of the
        covenant, like little Lazarus there; a scribe was I during all the
        working days of my life. I did what the Law and the Sages command,
        yet never thought I in so doing of men’s thoughts or praises. Surely,
        if the Lord command, a good Jew will obey. And as in many things,
        many acts of this life, the Law speaketh not in plain terms, surely
        we should follow the opinion of those who devote all their life to
        the study of the Law.</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page108">[pg 108]</span><a name="Pg108" id="Pg108" class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I have never sought the praises of men, their greetings
        or their honors, in obeying the Law. In all that I have done I have
        sought one thing—to fulfil the will of our Father which is in
        heaven.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“As for what thou sayest, that inward thought and outward
        act should go together in the service of God and man, that is a
        verity, and often have I heard the saying from the great Hillel—may
        his memory be for a blessing! But if outward act may be clean when
        inward thought may be unclean, how, on the other hand, can we know
        the purity of what is within, except it be decided by the cleanliness
        of what is without? How, above all, shall we teach our little ones,
        like my Lazarus there, to feel what is good and seemly, except by
        first teaching them to do the acts that are seemly and
        good?</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And as for what thou sayest as to the hypocrisy of us
        Pharisees and scribes, I say unto thee,—and in a few days I must see
        the face of my Maker,—I say unto thee, I have known many an Ebionite,
        which thou seemest to be, who was well spoken within, but ill doing
        without. So, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page109">[pg
        109]</span><a name="Pg109" id="Pg109" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>too,
        I have known many a scribe and many a Pharisee who neither carried
        their good deeds on their shoulders, nor said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Wait, I have to finish some godly deed;’</span> nor set
        off their good deeds against their sins; nor boasted of their
        sacrifices for godly works; nor did they seek out their sins that
        they might pay for them by their virtues; nor were they Pharisees
        from fear of the Divine punishment. They were Pharisees from love of
        the Lord, and did throughout their life what they knew to be his
        commands.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But Jesus spoke
        gently unto the old man, and said naught but, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Nay, master, I spoke not of thee, nor of men like thee.
        These be the true Pharisees; the rest but have the Pharisaic
        color.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“That is so,”</span> said old Simeon. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I have heard what King Jannaus said: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Fear not the Pharisees, nor those who are no Pharisees;
        but fear the colored ones, who are only Pharisees in appearance, who
        do the deeds of Zimri and demand the rewards of
        Phineas.’</span> ”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But before the old
        man could finish there was a movement at the doorway, <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page110">[pg 110]</span><a name="Pg110" id="Pg110"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and a high, thin voice cried out,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Where is this kidnapper of souls? where is

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        voice; and an old man, with the rent garment of the mourner, and with
        hair all distraught, came up to the Nazarene with arms outstretched
        and clutching fingers.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Give me my son, my Elchanan!”</span> he cried.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou hast taken him from me last Passover,

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But a few days
        after what I have narrated to thee, I had attended a full meeting of
        the Sanhedrim in the hall of hewn stones in the Priests’ Court of the
        Temple. When the session was over, we went forth, and, turning to the
        right, passed into the Court of the Israelites, and so through
        Nicanor’s Gate into the Court of the Women. Now, as we went down the
        fifteen steps that lead into this court, we could see, through the
        Beautiful Gate at the other end of it, that something unusual was
        occurring in the outer court of all, the Court of the Gentiles. So I
        and some of the other younger members of the Sanhedrim passed rapidly
        through the Court of the Women, and, hurrying through the Beautiful
        Gate, found Jesus preaching to the people under Solomon’s Porch. Now,
        it is usual for the people to make way when any member of the
        Sanhedrim passes by; but the people were so engrossed with the words
        of Jesus <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page114">[pg
        114]</span><a name="Pg114" id="Pg114" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>that
        they took no note of me and my companions, and we had to stand at the
        edge of the crowd and listen as best we might, and so great was the
        crowd that I could scarcely hear what the Nazarene was saying, until
        gradually those near us, recognizing the marks of our dignity, made
        way for us till we got nearer.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Never saw I Jesus
        in so exalted a state. Though he was not tall, as I have said, he
        seemed to tower above the crowd. The mid-day sun of winter was
        shining full upon the Temple, and though Jesus was in the shadow of
        the porch, the sunlight from the Temple walls shone back upon his
        eyes and hair, which gleamed with the glory of the sun. He looked and
        spake as a king among men. And, indeed, he was claiming to be
        something even greater than a king. I could not hear very distinctly
        from where I was at first, but towards the last, as I got nearer, I
        heard him say these words:—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style=
        "margin-bottom: 2.00em; margin-top: 2.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin. Except a
        man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. He <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg 115]</span><a name="Pg115" id="Pg115"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>that loveth his life shall lose it. If a
        man keep my word he shall never see death, but has passed from death
        unto life. He that believeth in me, the works that I do shall he do
        also. Yet can the Son do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the
        Father do. I am the door: by me, if any man enter in, he shall be
        saved. I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life. I am the Light of the
        world. I am the good Shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of
        mine. I am the Bread of Life: he that cometh to me shall never
        hunger. I am the true Vine, and my Father is the Husbandman. I am the
        Vine, ye are the branches. If any man thirst, let him come unto me
        and drink. Before Abraham was I am.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, as Jesus was
        saying these words, and many like unto them, his form seemed to
        expand, his eye flashed with the light of prophecy, and all men were
        amazed at the power of his words. Never had they heard man speak of
        himself with such confidence. If he had been very God, he could not
        have said more of his own power over men’s <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page116">[pg 116]</span><a name="Pg116" id="Pg116" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>souls. Our prophets have spoken boldly indeed,
        but none of them had boasted of the power of the Lord in such terms
        as this man spake of himself. Could he be mad, I thought, to say such
        things? Yet in all other matters he had shown a wisdom and a sound
        sense equal to the greatest of our Sages. Or had he found that by
        speaking thus of himself, men, and above all, women, were best moved
        to believe as he would have them believe, to act as he would have
        them act? Might it not be the simplest of truths that for them, to
        them, he was indeed the Way, the Truth, and the Life?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And, indeed, when
        I looked around and saw the effect of his words on those who were
        listening, I could in part understand his power among men and women.
        They drank in his words as travellers at the well of the oasis. They
        lived upon his eyes, and it was indeed strange to see every man’s
        body bent forward as of a straining hound at the chase. If ever men
        worshipped a man, these were worshipping Jesus.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And I? What was it
        with me that his words failed to move me as they did those
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page117">[pg 117]</span><a name="Pg117"
        id="Pg117" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>around me? Why did his eyes
        rather repel than attract me? Was it thy teaching, Aglaophonos, that
        had taught me the way of thy race: to measure all things in the
        balance of wisdom; to be moved in all acts by reason, not feeling?
        Was it from thee I learnt to think about the causes of this man’s
        influence, even while I and others were under it? Perhaps not alone;
        for much that this man was saying would have repelled my Jewish
        instincts even had I never come under thy influence. What struck thee
        among us Jews, I remember, was that while we see the Deity
        everywhere, we localize him nowhere. Alone among the nations of men
        we refuse to make an image of our God. We alone never regarded any
        man as God Incarnate. Those among us who have been nearest to the
        Divine have only claimed to be—they have only been recognized to
        be—messengers of the Most High. Yet here was this man, as it seemed,
        claiming to be the Very God, and all my Jewish feeling rose against
        the claim.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nor was I alone in
        this feeling I was <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg
        118]</span><a name="Pg118" id="Pg118" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>soon
        to learn. Before Jesus had finished his harangue, cries arose from
        different quarters of the crowd. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Blasphemy!”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Blasphemer!”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“He
        blasphemes!”</span> arose on all sides. These cries awakened men as
        if from a sleep, all turning round to see whence they came. And the
        very turning round, as it were, removed them from the influence of
        Jesus and his eyes. In a moment, many of those who just before were
        hanging upon Jesus’ words joined in the cry, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Blasphemer! blasphemer!”</span> One of the boldest of
        those who began the cry called out, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Blasphemer! Stone him!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But Jesus drew
        himself up, and looked upon the crowd with flashing eyes, and said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“O Jerusalem, Jerusalem! Sodom is justified
        of thee.”</span> For a moment all were silent, but soon the cries
        arose again: <span class="tei tei-q">“Blasphemer! blasphemer! Stone
        him!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then began great
        commotion among the people. While some called out, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Stone him!”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Stone
        him!”</span> others cried, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Sacrilege!”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Sacrilege!”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“No stoning
        in the Temple!”</span> And one called out with a jeer, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“In the Temple ye cannot <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page119">[pg 119]</span><a name="Pg119" id="Pg119" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>stone, for lo! here there be no stones;”</span>
        and a bitter, scornful laugh followed his words. Then some who were
        nearest to Jesus sought to lay hands on him, while others, his
        friends, stood round him and prevented their approaching, and all was
        confusion and tumult. When suddenly the blare of a trumpet sounded
        through the courts, and all cried, <span class="tei tei-q">“The
        Romans! the Romans!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then round by the
        royal porch came a company of Roman soldiers to change the sentries
        at mid-day, and they halted near the Beautiful Gate. And as they came
        near the crowd began to disperse, and Jesus and his friends went
        their way from the courts of the Temple.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That day, there
        was no talk in Jerusalem but of the event in the Temple. Men
        marvelled at the way in which this Jesus had spoken of himself.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“The prophets spake not thus,”</span> they
        said. <span class="tei tei-q">“Yet how can a man be greater than a
        prophet, who speaketh the words of the Most High? Even if we had once
        more a king over us in Israel, he could not be as great as a prophet,
        and no king would speak of him<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page120">[pg 120]</span><a name="Pg120" id="Pg120" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>self as Jesus this day hath spoken of
        himself.”</span> But what if this man were destined to be the Christ,
        the God-given Ruler that should restore the throne of David? But how
        could that be, since none of the signs and portents of the last times
        had come upon the earth? Who had seen the blood trickle from the
        rocks? or the fiery sword appear in the midnight sky? Had babes a
        year old spoken like men? But others said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Nay, the kingdom of God will not come with expectation.
        As it hath been said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Three things come
        unexpectedly—a scorpion, a treasure-trove, and the
        Messiah.’</span> ”</span> And again, others said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Perchance this is not the Messiah ben David, but the
        Messiah ben Joseph, who shall be slain before the other
        cometh.”</span> Thus the minds of men and their words went hither and
        thither about the sayings of this man Jesus in the Temple.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I heard naught and
        saw naught of Jesus the Nazarene till the very last week of his life,
        and that was the week before the Passover. The winter had been a
        severe one, and much misery had arisen among the folk through the
        exactions of the Romans; indeed, an attempt had been made to throw
        off the Roman yoke. In several places the people had assembled in
        arms and attacked the soldiery, and in some cases had slain their
        sentries. Pilate had but sent off a cohort into the district, and all
        signs of discontent went underground. One of the leaders of the
        revolt, Jesus Bar Abbas, had been captured and thrown into prison.
        He, indeed, had attempted an insurrection in Jerusalem itself, where
        he was well known and popular among the common folk. When he was
        arrested, a riot had occurred, and one of the soldiers was slain who
        had been sent to arrest him; wherefore he lay now in prison on the
        charges of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg
        124]</span><a name="Pg124" id="Pg124" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>rebellion and murder. Yet many thought that this
        man had been put forth to try the temper of the people and the power
        of the Romans, in preparation for a more serious attempt to shake off
        the oppressor.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet who should
        lead the people? Jochanan, the only man whom of recent times the
        people followed gladly, had been done to death by Herod. One man
        alone since his death had won the people’s heart, to wit, Jesus the
        cousin of Jochanan. He, and he alone, could lead the people against
        the Romans, and all men wondered if he would. In the midst of their
        wonder came news that Jesus the Nazarene was coming up to the Holy
        City for the Feast of Passover, the feast of redemption from Egypt.
        Would it prove this year a feast of redemption from the Romans? All
        hope of this depended upon this Jesus.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was twenty-one
        years ago, but I can remember as if it were yesterday the excitement
        in Jerusalem when the news came that Jesus of Nazareth had arrived in
        the neighborhood, and was spending his Sabbath at the village of
        Bethany. All those who were disaffected against the Romans
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page125">[pg 125]</span><a name="Pg125"
        id="Pg125" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>cried out, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“A leader! a leader!”</span> All those who were halt,
        sick, or blind, cried out, <span class="tei tei-q">“A healer! a
        healer!”</span> Wherever we went, there was no talk but of the coming
        deliverance. As I approached one group of men I heard them say,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“When will it be? When will he give the sign?
        Will it be before or after the feast?”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Nay,”</span> said one of the crowd, a burly blacksmith
        he, <span class="tei tei-q">“what day for the deliverance but the
        Passover day? But be it when it may, let him give the sign, and I
        shall be ready.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And prove a new Maccabee,”</span> said one in the crowd,
        referring to his hammer, whereat a grim laugh arose.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next day being
        the first of the week, which the Romans call the Day of the Sun, I
        was pondering the words of the Law in my little study chamber near
        the roof of my father’s house in the Street of the Bakers near
        Herod’s Palace, which at that time was inhabited by the Procurator,
        when suddenly I heard the patter of many feet in the street beneath
        me, and looking out, I saw them all hurrying, as it seemed, to the
        Temple. I put on my sandals, and taking my staff in my hand and
        drawing <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page126">[pg 126]</span><a name=
        "Pg126" id="Pg126" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>my mantle over my head,
        hurried out after the passers-by. But when they came to the Broad
        Place before the Water Gate, they turned sharp to the right, and went
        down the Tyropœon as far as the Fountain Gate, where I overtook them.
        There I found all the most turbulent of the city population. Some of
        the men I knew had been engaged in the recent riot under Jesus Bar
        Abbas. Others were the leading Zealots in Jerusalem, and all were men
        eager for the freeing of the city from the Romans. And among them,
        too, were others who cared not for freedom, nor hated the Romans, but
        would only be too pleased if the city were given up to disorder and
        rapine. While these waited there, we heard cries from behind us, and
        looking back, saw filing out from the Temple courts on to the Xystus
        Bridge, and down into the Tyropœon, the brigade of beggars who pass
        almost their whole life in the Court of the Gentiles. These came down
        slowly, for among them were many halt and some blind, and all were
        old and feeble of limb. <span class="tei tei-q">“Why come they forth
        from the courts?”</span> I asked; <span class="tei tei-q">“and why
        are we waiting?”</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg
        127]</span><a name="Pg127" id="Pg127" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Then
        said one near me, <span class="tei tei-q">“Knowest thou not that
        Jesus the Nazarene enters the city to-day? And men say he is to
        deliver us.”</span> And at that moment a cry arose among the folk,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Lo! there he is.”</span> Looking south, for
        a time I could see nothing, for the mid-day sun of the spring
        solstice was shining with that radiance which we Jews think is only
        to be seen in our land. But after a while I could discern, turning
        the corner of the Jericho Road near En Rogel, a mounted man,
        surrounded by a number of men and women on foot. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It is Jesus—it is Jesus!”</span> all cried; <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“let us to meet him!”</span> And with that, all but the
        lame rushed forward to meet him, and I with them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is but three
        hundred paces from the Fountain Gate to En Rogel, and the Nazarene
        and his friends had advanced somewhat to meet us, but in that short
        space the enthusiasm of the crowd had arisen to a very fever, and as
        we neared him one cried out, and all joined in the cry, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Hosanna Barabba! Hosanna Barabba!”</span> and then they
        shouted our usual cry of welcome, <span class="tei tei-q">“Blessed be
        he that cometh in the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page128">[pg
        128]</span><a name="Pg128" id="Pg128" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>name
        of the Lord!”</span> and one bolder than his fellows called out,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Blessed be the coming of the
        kingdom!”</span> At that there was the wildest joy among the people.
        Some tore off branches of palms, and stood by the way and waved them
        in front of Jesus; others took off each his <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">talith</span></span> and threw it down in front
        of the young ass on which Jesus rode, as if to pave the way into the
        Holy City with choice linen. But when I looked upon the face of
        Jesus, there were no signs there of the coming triumph; he sat with
        his head bent forward, his eyes downcast, and his face all sad. And a
        chill somehow came over me. I thought of that play of the Greeks
        which thou gavest me to read, in which the king of men, driving to
        his own palace at Argos, is enticed to enter it, stepping upon soft
        carpets like an idol of your gods, and so incurs the divine
        jealousy.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As we approached
        the Fountain Gate, the beggars from the Temple had come down to it,
        and joined in the shouting and the welcome; and one of them, Tobias
        ben Pinchas by name, who had, ever since men had known him, walked
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page129">[pg 129]</span><a name="Pg129"
        id="Pg129" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>with a crutch, suddenly, in his
        excitement, raised his crutch and waved it over his head, and danced
        before Jesus, crying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Hosanna Barabba!
        Hosanna Barabba!”</span> and all men cried out, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“A miracle, a miracle! what cannot this man
        perform?”</span> And so, with a crowd surrounding him, Jesus entered
        Jerusalem and went up into the Temple. But I that year had been
        appointed one of the overseers who distributed the unleavened bread
        to the poor of the city for the coming Passover, and I had then to
        attend the meeting of my fellow-overseers.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That night there
        was no talk in Jerusalem but of the triumphant entry of Jesus. The
        city was crowded by Israelites who had come up to the capital for the
        festival, and a whisper went about that many of the strangers had
        been summoned by Jesus to Jerusalem to help in the coming revolt.
        During that night, wherever a Roman sentry stood, a crowd of the
        unruly would collect round him and jeer at him; and in one place the
        sentry had to use his spear, and wounded one of the crowd. So great
        was the tumult that, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page130">[pg
        130]</span><a name="Pg130" id="Pg130" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>when
        the sentries were changed for the midnight watch, a whole company of
        soldiers accompanied the officer’s guard and helped to clear the
        streets. Meanwhile, where was Jesus? And what was he doing in the
        midst of this tumult? I made inquiry, for perchance he might have
        been holding disputations about the Law, as is the custom with our
        Sages; but I learnt that he had left the city at the eleventh hour,
        and gone back to the village of Bethany, where he was staying. But I
        was thinking through all that evening of the strange contrast between
        the triumphant joy of his followers and the saddened countenance of
        the Nazarene.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Men knew not what
        was to become of this movement in favor of him. Most of the lower
        orders were hoping for a rising against the Romans to be led by this
        Jesus. Shrewder ones among the Better thought that the man was about
        to initiate a change in the spiritual government of our people. Some
        thought he would depose the Sadducees, and place the Pharisees in
        their stead. Others feared that he would carry into practice the
        ideals <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page131">[pg 131]</span><a name=
        "Pg131" id="Pg131" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of the <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Ebionim</span></span>, and raise the Poor
        against the Rich. Others said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Why did he
        not enter by the gate of the Essenes, for he holdeth with
        them?”</span> All knew that the coming Passover would be a trying
        time for Israel, owing to the presence of the man Jesus in Jerusalem,
        and the manifest favor in which he was held by the common folk. But
        amidst all this I could see only the pale, sad face of
        Jesus.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page132">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the morrow,
        being the second day of the week, which the Romans call the Day of
        the Moon, Jesus of Nazara came early into Jerusalem, and as soon as
        it was known that he had entered the city, all those that had gone
        out to greet him on the previous day, and many more with them who had
        heard of the miracle that he had performed, went to meet him in the
        Broad Place. And near upon the time of the mid-day sacrifice, Jesus
        and all these men went up to the Temple.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, I have told
        thee how, when Jesus had first come to Jerusalem, he had driven forth
        from the Court of the Gentiles all those who were engaged in selling
        beasts of sacrifice, or in changing foreign moneys for the shekels.
        But the money-changers and others had been replaced by the orders of
        the High Priest Hanan, and nothing had come of this action, nor in
        his later visits to Jerusalem had he done <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page136">[pg 136]</span><a name="Pg136" id="Pg136" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>aught in the matter, and it was thought that he
        had acknowledged the right and the power of the priests to have the
        monopoly of the sale of sacrifices. Now, that day of the Moon was the
        tenth day of the month Nisan, and upon it were purchased all the
        lambs for the forthcoming Passover sacrifices, as it is said in the
        Law, <span class="tei tei-q">“In the tenth day of this month they
        shall take to them every man a lamb according to the house of their
        fathers, a lamb for an house.”</span> As this Paschal sacrifice is
        the only home sacrifice of us Jews, thou mightest imagine that each
        householder could obtain his lamb whence he would; but the priests
        say <span class="tei tei-q">“No”</span> to this, for if a man could
        take any chance lamb, it might not be without blemish. So it had
        grown to be a custom that, on the morning of the tenth day of Nisan,
        the heads of households in Jerusalem should wend their way to the
        courts of the Temple, there to select each man a lamb. And the
        priests had their profit in this, for they claimed from those who
        sold the lambs dues for every animal allowed to be in the courts. And
        the sellers <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page137">[pg
        137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>again were agreeable to this, for none that had
        not the favor could sell the Paschal lambs. Whence it was that the
        price of a lamb in the Paschal week was more than three times as much
        as at any time of the year, and the poorer people murmured
        greatly.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus it happened
        that upon this day, when Jesus came into the courts of the Temple,
        these were crowded with all the householders of Jerusalem, and much
        chaffering and haggling was going on in the purchase of the lambs for
        the Passover. But Jesus, with the favor he had won from the people,
        was for this day at least Ruler of Jerusalem, and men wondered what
        he would do with regard to this sale and purchase of the beasts of
        sacrifice; for on his first coming to Jerusalem, as I have told thee,
        he had driven the sellers away, but afterwards, when they had been
        restored to their places, he had seemed to acquiesce. What would he
        do now, men thought, as they saw him advancing over the Xystus
        Bridge, the head of a vast concourse of people who would do all that
        he told them?</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page138">[pg
        138]</span><a name="Pg138" id="Pg138" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They had not long
        to wait, for no sooner had he entered the Temple courts, than he
        spake to those around him, and ordered them to remove the tables of
        the money-changers, with their weights and scales, without which no
        purchase could be; and no man dared say him nay, for all knew that
        the people were with him. And they, indeed, were rejoiced, for they
        took this as permission to buy their Paschal lambs where they would;
        and many of those who had been bargaining in the courts of the Temple
        went off at once to the market, and got them their lambs from thence.
        All this I heard of in the inner courts of the Temple, for it chanced
        that day that I had to offer a sin offering, and was waiting my turn
        in the Court of the Israelites while the priests were preparing the
        mid-day sacrifice. And I saw one coming up to Hanan and to Joseph
        Caiaphas, who were presiding over the sacrifice, and they spake
        earnestly to one another, and stopped the sacrifice, and came through
        the Court of the Israelites and went down the Court of the Women, and
        all of us followed them thither. And <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page139">[pg 139]</span><a name="Pg139" id="Pg139" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>when we came to the Beautiful Gate, and turned
        to the right round the corner of the Temple, behold, we saw the
        flocks of Paschal lambs being driven through the Western Gates. And
        in the midst of the court stood Jesus, surrounded by a multitude
        clamoring and shouting. Then saw I Hanan lean over to Joseph
        Caiaphas, his son-in-law, and speak somewhat to him. Then the latter
        advanced in front of the priests and the scribes, who had come forth
        with him, and asked, <span class="tei tei-q">“Who hath done
        this?”</span> And Jesus said, <span class="tei tei-q">“It is
        I.”</span> Then spake Joseph again and said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Tell us, by what authority doest thou these things? And
        who gave thee this authority?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, Joseph the
        High Priest was clad this day in the robes of his office, with tiara
        on head, the ephod on his breast, and silver bells and pomegranates
        round the edge of his garment. Whereas Jesus the Nazarene wore his
        wonted garb of a common country workman. Yet for the moment this
        common workman was the greater power of the two; since all men knew
        how he had been received by the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page140">[pg 140]</span><a name="Pg140" id="Pg140" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>people when he had come into Jerusalem, and that
        what he willed, all the people of Jerusalem willed also at that time.
        So all were hushed to hear what this Jesus would say to the question
        of the High Priest, since now they thought he must declare himself,
        and justify the power he was exercising.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But here again, as
        on former occasions, Jesus answered not directly to the question of
        the priests, but rather questioned them. He said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I also ask you one thing, which if ye tell me, I
        likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things. The
        baptism of Jochanan, was it from heaven or of men? Answer me.”</span>
        And they answered and said unto Jesus, <span class="tei tei-q">“We
        cannot tell.”</span> Then said Jesus unto them, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Then neither will I tell by what authority I do these
        things. To what is the matter like? There was a man had two sons. And
        the man came to the first, and said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘My son,
        go work in my vineyard.’</span> But he said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘I will not.’</span> Howbeit afterward he repented, and
        went to work. But the man went to the second, and spake in like
        manner. But he answered, <span class="tei tei-q">‘I go, sir.’</span>
        But yet he went <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page141">[pg
        141]</span><a name="Pg141" id="Pg141" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>not.
        Whether of these twain did the will of his father?”</span> And we all
        answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“The first.”</span> Then Jesus
        looked slowly around at us all, and said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“This I say unto you, the publicans and harlots enter
        into the kingdom of heaven before you. For Jochanan came unto you in
        the way of righteousness, and ye heeded him not, but the harlots and
        the publicans heeded him: but ye, even when ye saw this, repented
        not.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, at this
        public insult to all of priestly rank, I saw dart forward Hanan the
        High Priest, as if he would have rent the man Jesus. But Caiaphas his
        son-in-law caught him by the wrist, and whispered words in his ear.
        But Hanan broke loose, and called out in a loud voice, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“My guard, my guard!”</span> Whereat many of the folk who
        had come with Jesus into the Court of the Gentiles came forward round
        him, and put their hands to their weapons. He indeed said naught, nor
        seemed aware of the conflict that threatened. But Caiaphas turned,
        and in a loud voice said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I go to perform
        the mid-day sacrifice,”</span> and walked slowly out of the court
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page142">[pg 142]</span><a name="Pg142"
        id="Pg142" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>back to the Temple. And we all
        followed him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, when we
        returned from performing the sacrifice, Jesus had left the courts of
        the Temple, which had become bare and empty of people. And as I went
        homeward to my house in the Street of the Bakers, I looked down from
        the Xystus Bridge, and saw trooping down the Tyropœon Jesus and a
        great multitude of the people, who crowded round him, as if eager to
        touch the hem of his garment. I stood and watched till they reached
        the Fountain Gate, through which he passed; and shortly afterwards I
        could see him on the road to the Fountain of Rogel, still accompanied
        by many of the people.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What was to come
        of that day’s work I knew not. For the first time the discontent of
        the common folk with the management of the Temple by the priests had
        come to a head, and had resulted in this open conflict between Jesus
        and the High Priests. The city was full of strangers excited by
        thoughts of the coming festival. The common people had not yet
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page143">[pg 143]</span><a name="Pg143"
        id="Pg143" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>calmed themselves from the
        thoughts of rebellion which had been raised by the rising of Jesus
        Bar Abbas and others. The whole city was as tow ready for the spark
        of fire.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page144">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, on the
        morrow, being the third day of the week, Jesus of Nazara came again
        into the city, and the rumor of his coming spread through all the
        streets and places of Jerusalem. And going forth after the morning
        prayers, I found Jesus with many around him in the Broad Place before
        the Water Gate. And as I approached near to them, I saw the crowd
        part asunder and a procession coming through, and almost all the men
        there bowed and did reverence to the men who were passing through.
        Now, these were mostly of the Pharisaic sect, who were going to the
        Great Beth Hamidrash, to pursue the study of the Law and to give
        decisions on legal questions which the common folk put to them. And
        at their head walked Jochanan ben Zaccai, the President of the
        Tribunal. He was regarded as the most capable exponent of the Law
        since the death of Hillel, whose favorite <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page148">[pg 148]</span><a name="Pg148" id="Pg148" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>pupil he had been, and men were wont to refer to
        him for decision in all the most difficult questions of life. He was
        walking at the head of the procession in his long <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">talith</span></span> with large borders and in
        his broad phylacteries. And he passed Jesus with a salutation,
        indeed, but in it was mingled some of the pride and contempt with
        which the masters of the Law regarded all those whom they call the
        Country-folk.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When these had
        passed, Jesus turned round to the people, and spake these words:</p>

        shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their
        fingers. But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make
        broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,
        and love the chief place at feasts, and the chief seats in the

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And all the people
        were astonished at these words, for in many of his sayings and most
        of his actions Jesus had seemed to <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page152">[pg 152]</span><a name="Pg152" id="Pg152" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>incline more to the sect of the Pharisees than
        to any other section of the house of Israel. And, indeed, in the
        opening words of his discourse he had granted their right to
        interpret the Law and to lead the people. Yet wherefore had he
        denounced them all without distinction as men insincere and void of
        truth? Hypocrites there were among them as among other classes of
        men. Often, indeed, their acts did not go with their words; but of
        what man can it be said that all his acts and words go together?
        These men were occupied in building a rampart to the Law, and holding
        the fortress against enemies without and dissensions within. Those
        ramparts might confine our actions within a narrow space, yet is it
        not well for all men to be kept perforce in the path of duty? I know
        thou thinkest otherwise, Aglaophonos. Thy Master the Stagyrite has
        taught thee that man should be a law unto himself; but we Jews
        willingly bear the yoke of the Law, because we believe it to be the
        yoke of the Lord. And in this matter Jesus had in every way shown
        himself to be a Jew of the Jews. Why, then, was he so <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page153">[pg 153]</span><a name="Pg153" id="Pg153"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>in wrath against the interpreters of the
        Law?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet were the
        common folk not displeased at these sayings of Jesus; nay, rather
        they applauded them. For in many ways our Sages have failed to find
        favor with the common folk of Israel; for besides that they would
        regulate their lives at every point, so that no man dare do this or
        do that except in the way the Sages prescribe, but chiefly the rabbis
        were out of favor with the folk for that they did openly despise and
        condemn all but those who were learned in the Law. The unlearned they
        called the Country-folk. Wherefore did the people hear with pleasure
        the bitter words Jesus spake against the scribes and the
        Pharisees.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The night of that
        same day an event occurred which roused the city of Jerusalem to a
        pitch of expectation such as I had never seen there. Two young

        kindness of heart and good humor, fell into an altercation with a
        Roman officer near the Sheep Gate, not far from Antonia, where all
        the Roman soldiers lie. Without a word of warning, the Ro<span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thou canst imagine
        with what feelings of expectation all Jerusalem awaited the coming of
        Jesus next morning. Many of the Pharisees had come together the eve
        before, and spoken of the public insult Jesus had given to their sect
        on the preceding day. Hanan the High Priest, we heard, had quarrelled
        furiously with his son-in-law Joseph Caiaphas, for that he had not
        allowed him to summon his guard after the humiliation he had put upon
        them in the Temple. Yet neither the Pharisees nor the Sadducees who
        followed the High Priests dared lay hands upon this Jesus, because of
        the evident favor in which he was held by the common folk of
        Jerusalem, and above all by the many from country parts who had come
        up, like him, to spend the Passover in the Holy City. Among all these
        there was no talk but of Jesus the Liberator; nay! many spake of him
        as Jesus the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page158">[pg
        158]</span><a name="Pg158" id="Pg158" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>Christ. And if he were indeed to be the Christ,
        the King of Israel, the Founder of the New Kingdom, it could not be
        that he would suffer longer the yoke of the Romans to lie upon the
        neck of Israel.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet there was one
        thing that perplexed many, and opinion went hither and thither among
        the minds of men concerning it. The Christ who was to deliver Israel
        and to rule over mankind, was he not to be the son of David? Yet this
        Jesus was of Galilee, where the admixture of blood had been greatest
        in all Israel. <span class="tei tei-q">“There is no unleavened bread
        in all Galilee,”</span> the scoffers used to say, meaning thereby
        that their genealogy was sprinkled with yeast, as we call foreign
        admixture. And for this man’s genealogy, who could declare it? Many,
        indeed, as I have told thee, thought him to have no right even to be
        called son of his father. A <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">mamzer</span></span>
        shall not sit in the congregation of Israel. How, then, could one
        ascend Israel’s throne?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When, therefore,
        Jesus came next morning from his lodging in Bethany, all Jerusalem
        turned out to welcome him, for the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page159">[pg 159]</span><a name="Pg159" id="Pg159" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>Passover was coming anear, and if aught was to
        be done to clear the city of the Romans, it must be done quickly,
        must be done on that day. Never saw I the courts of the Temple so
        crowded as on that day when I came thither, and found Jesus standing
        in the Court of the Gentiles, with almost all the leading men of
        Jerusalem and many of the common folk surging about him. Scarce room
        was left for the Roman sentry to march his guard in front of the
        Beautiful Gate. Yet he took no heed of us barbarians, but with shield
        and spear shouldered his way backward and forward, backward and
        forward, a sign to all men that the house of God was in the hands of
        God’s enemies.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Never saw I the
        men of Jerusalem so exultant as on that morning. Wherever I looked,
        joy—a grim joy—was on every man’s countenance, and there was no man
        there but was armed, save only Jesus himself and some ten or a dozen
        men who had come with him from Bethany, and these, indeed, were the
        only men who had not shown joy. Never had I seen the Nazarene with a
        countenance so saddened and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page160">[pg
        160]</span><a name="Pg160" id="Pg160" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>aweary. Yestermorn he had been flashing with
        anger and indignation as he spake his words against the Pharisees,
        but on this day his force seemed to be spent, and he appeared like
        one who had passed through a great agony.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, as they were
        standing there, I saw a man, one of the leaders of the Zealots, armed
        as if for battle, go up and lay a hand upon one of those with Jesus.
        He spake eagerly with him, and pointed with his thumb to the Roman
        soldier as he passed to and fro. But the other shook his head
        vehemently, and took his arm away from the grasp of the Zealot and
        turned his back upon him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, at this
        moment certain of the Pharisees came through the crowd and advanced
        to Jesus. So great was the crowd that I heard not at first what they
        said unto him; but it must have been some question about the matter
        that was in all men’s minds, for I heard his reply, and that, as was
        his wont, was in the form of a counter-question to their inquiry, for
        he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“What think <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ye</span></span> of the
        Christ? Whose son is he?”</span> And they, speaking <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page161">[pg 161]</span><a name="Pg161" id="Pg161"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>with the thought of all Israel, said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“The Christ is the son of David.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then all men
        watched with expectancy to hear what the Nazarene would say to this;
        for if he agreed with them, then would he deny himself to be the
        Christ: for his genealogy had by no means been proven. But yet, how
        could he disprove the belief of all Israel, that the Christ was the
        Son of David? Yet that did he after the manner of our Sages, using
        words of Scripture as his confirmation; for he said unto them,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“How then is it that David himself saith in
        the Book of Psalms, <span class="tei tei-q">‘The Lord said unto my
        Lord, Sit thou on my right hand until I make thine enemies thy
        footstool’</span>? David therefore himself calleth the Christ Lord;
        how then can the Christ be his son?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this the
        Pharisees knew not what to say, for no man had hitherto used that
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">stichos</span></span> of the Psalms, and they
        knew not what to reply. But the common folk were rejoiced
        exceedingly; joy spread on their faces, and I saw many a fist raised
        and shaken in exultant defiance at the Roman sentry, who walked
        hither and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page162">[pg
        162]</span><a name="Pg162" id="Pg162" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>thither on his guard as if he were a living mass
        of steel.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thereupon certain
        of the crowd who were known to be followers of Herod had speech with
        Jesus, and spake to him: <span class="tei tei-q">“Master, we know
        that thou art true, and carest for no man; that thou regardest not
        the person of men, but teachest the way of God in all truth—tell us,
        therefore, what thinkest thou: is it lawful to give tribute to Cæsar
        or not? shall we give, or shall we not give?”</span> All men were
        silent, and drew their breath to hear what Jesus might say to this.
        For if he claimed to be the Anointed One, to whom but to the King of
        Israel should Israel’s tribute be paid?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But he said unto
        them, <span class="tei tei-q">“Why tempt ye me? Bring me a denarius,
        that I may see it.”</span> And they brought one and put it into his
        hand. And he held it forth unto them, and said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Whose is this image and superscription?”</span> And they
        answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“Cæsar’s.”</span> And then Jesus
        said unto them, <span class="tei tei-q">“Render to Cæsar the things
        that are Cæsar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”</span> And
        these Herodians mar<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page163">[pg
        163]</span><a name="Pg163" id="Pg163" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>velled at the subtlety with which he had
        answered them, but the common folk were amazed and dumfounded at his
        answer. And soon I heard one say to another, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“He denieth: he would pay tribute to Cæsar.”</span> And
        gradually all the men drew away from him, leaving him alone with only
        the company with him from Bethany.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But he, seeing
        this, turned to one of those with him, and said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Peter, of whom do the kings of the earth take custom? of
        their own children, or of the aliens?”</span> And Peter answered and
        said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Of the aliens.”</span> Then Jesus said
        to him, <span class="tei tei-q">“Then are the children free?”</span>
        And Peter said to him, <span class="tei tei-q">“Yes.”</span> Then
        said Jesus unto him, <span class="tei tei-q">“Then do thou also give,
        as being an alien to them.”</span> The common folk heard this,
        indeed, but were in no wise satisfied. If they were to give tribute
        to the Romans for whatever cause, they were still to be under
        subjection to Rome, and then Jesus refused to be their Liberator;
        that had become clear to them of a sudden. And they drew still
        further away from him. And a deep silence of mortification fell upon
        all men there, so that thou couldst <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page164">[pg 164]</span><a name="Pg164" id="Pg164" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>hear distinctly the tread of the Roman sentry as
        he moved on his march.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Amid the deep
        silence suddenly came a gentle tinkling, as of silver bells; it came
        nearer and nearer, and a crier called out, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Way for the High Priests!”</span> Then Hanan the High
        Priest, with Caiaphas his son-in-law, and others of the priests
        accompanied by their guard, came down the steps from the Beautiful
        Gate. The Roman sentry stopped his march and stood upright, with
        spear on ground, and all made way as the procession of the High
        Priests passed through the court. All men were silent, and thou
        couldst hear the tinkling of the silver bells which were attached to
        the hems of the High Priests’ garments. Hanan walked at the head of
        the procession with his usual haughty gait, and had nearly passed
        through the court, when he saw Jesus and those with him. At once he
        halted, and summoned one of the crowd to him. Then we saw much eager
        talk between this man and the High Priest. And Hanan summoned the
        captain of his guard, who would have turned towards Jesus, but that
        Joseph <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page165">[pg 165]</span><a name=
        "Pg165" id="Pg165" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Caiaphas stayed him and
        spake unto Hanan, pointing to the Roman sentry. After much talk
        between these, the High Priests resumed their march and left the
        Temple. And all the other men began to pass away from the court,
        leaving Jesus and his men alone with none to listen to him. For the
        word passed swiftly in the mouths of all the men of
        Jerusalem,—<span class="tei tei-q">“He refuseth; he would have us be
        slaves of the Romans forever.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next day being
        the fifth day of the week, and the thirteenth day of the month Nisan
        in that year, many rumors went about the city as to the man Jesus.
        There were who said that he had been seized by the guards of Hanan;
        others said that he had left the village of Bethany and gone no man
        knew whither. But for that day Jesus came not into Jerusalem, and
        men’s minds were occupied more with one of the difficulties of our
        Law which form the occupation and delight of our Sages. I must
        explain this unto thee, for upon it turn the events of the next day,
        so fateful for the man about whom thou art inquiring. Thou canst
        easily understand what I shall say, for thou hast, I know, a copy of
        the Scriptures in Greek, for did I not procure it for thee?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is said in the
        Law, thou wilt find, that the Passover lamb is to be killed in the
        twilight between the fourteenth and the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page170">[pg 170]</span><a name="Pg170" id="Pg170" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>fifteenth of Nisan, and it is also said in our
        Law that the whole of the lamb must be consumed that evening. Now, in
        the years when the fifteenth of Nisan, which is the first day of the
        Passover, falleth upon the Sabbath, the killing and roasting of the
        lamb would take place on the Sabbath eve, when no killing must take
        place and no fire must be lit. Hence arises a conflict of the Law of
        the Passover with the Law of the Sabbath. Now, the older view was,
        that the Passover was superior to the Sabbath, and its law was to be
        followed in preference. This the priests held and followed, and in
        this they seemed to have the authority of the great Hillel, who also
        declared the Passover superior to the Sabbath.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But many among the
        Pharisees and the more pious preferred to slay the Passover lamb on
        the eve between the thirteenth and the fourteenth day of Nisan, and
        to eat it on the fourteenth day; that is, in those years when the
        Passover fell on the Sabbath, as was the case in the year of which I
        am now writing. It would appear that Jesus and his followers held
        with the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page171">[pg
        171]</span><a name="Pg171" id="Pg171" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>latter opinion, for, as I have heard, on the eve
        of the fourteenth of Nisan he came stealthily into the city of
        Jerusalem, and ate the Passover lamb concealed in an upper chamber of
        one of his friends in the city. It showeth how earnest this man was
        in following the larger precepts of the Law, though in smaller
        matters he seemed to neglect it. For by this time he must have known
        that he was no longer safe in Jerusalem; and, indeed, he proved this
        by his secret entry into it. Yet in order to fulfil the Law, which
        saith, <span class="tei tei-q">“The Passover lamb is to be eaten in
        Jerusalem,”</span> he risked his own and his followers’ lives. Yet
        was he careful of them; for, as thou shalt soon hear, as soon as he
        had gone through the meal prescribed by the Law, he escaped out of
        Jerusalem.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, that night I
        was standing at the door of my house, looking upon the city bathed in
        the light of the moon, which was near its full, when suddenly a man
        seized me by the arm and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou art
        wanted.”</span> I looked, and behold it was Simon Kantheros, my
        brother-in-law. And I said to him, <span class="tei tei-q">“Who wants
        me? and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page172">[pg 172]</span><a name=
        "Pg172" id="Pg172" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>wherefore?”</span> And
        Simon answered me and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Hanan the High
        Priest has summoned suddenly a meeting of the Sanhedrim at his house
        on the Mount of Olives.”</span> Then said I, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“But if it be at his house, it can only be the Priestly
        Sanhedrim of Twenty-Three that he summons.”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Nay, nay, man,”</span> answered Simon, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the case is urgent. He saith, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘any member of the Sanhedrim.’</span> Come, then, with
        me, and quickly.”</span> So with that I seized my mantle and my
        staff, and went forth with him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So we hurried
        across the market-place towards the Fish Gate, and as we passed near
        the Tower Antonia, we saw the flashing of red lights, and heard
        hoarse cries of command, and knew not what was toward. But when we
        arrived at the Fish Gate, we found them changing the sentries of the
        first watch, and knew that the second watch had begun. At first the
        sentry would not let us through the gate; but the officer was called,
        and Simon showed him his badge as member of the Sanhedrim. But even
        this would not have sufficed, but that Simon then pointed to
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page173">[pg 173]</span><a name="Pg173"
        id="Pg173" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>his toga and the purple stripe,
        which showed that he was a Roman citizen of rank. Thereat the officer
        spake to the sentry, and we passed through the gate, and turned
        sharply to the right, and went down the road which leads to the
        valley of the Kidron. And as we were passing the Brook Kidron, we
        looked and saw dots of red light moving up the hill from the Garden
        of Gethsemane. And as we advanced up the hill of the Mount of Olives,
        we could see from time to time these red sparks preceding us; and
        when we came within sight of the High Priest’s house, we saw them
        enter in and disappear.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Soon we ourselves
        had come up to the gate, and when we knocked, a wicket was opened,
        and a face peered out, and our names were asked. When we had told
        them, the gate was closed, and we had to wait some time. But at last
        the door was opened, and the captain of the guard received us. He
        took us through the passage which led into the open court, with the
        water-basin in the centre, round which we skirted, and ascended the
        steps into the inner house. And again we stopped <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page174">[pg 174]</span><a name="Pg174" id="Pg174"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>before the hall-door while our names were
        asked, and again we had to wait till the door was at last opened.
        Then at last we entered the hall, and found Joseph Caiaphas the High
        Priest and many of his kinsmen seated round a long table. Caiaphas
        rose, and motioned us to two seats at the end of this table, and we
        seated ourselves.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When my eyes had
        become accustomed to the light, I looked round, and said the greeting
        of peace unto those I knew of the assembly. I can still remember many
        of their names. There was Ishmael ben Phabi, who had at first
        replaced Hanan as High Priest. There were also the four sons of
        Hanan—Eleazar, Jonathan, Theophilus, and Matthias. Then there were
        Kamithos the priest, and his two sons, Simon and Joseph. And beside
        these, I remember two men of my own generation—Elioni ben Kantheros
        and Chananyah ben Nedebai. Most of these men had been, or were
        afterwards, High Priests, and were all at this time members of the
        Priestly Sanhedrim. On the left of Caiaphas was a low stool, and,
        even as I looked, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page175">[pg

        "tei tei-anchor"></a>Hanan ben Seth the High Priest came in swiftly
        from a side door, and took a seat thereon. He glanced sharply round
        at each of us, counting our numbers, and we were exactly three and
        twenty. And when he saw me, he rose and spake somewhat harshly,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Meshullam ben Zadok, what dost thou here?
        This is a meeting of the Priestly Sanhedrim. Thou art a son of
        Israel.”</span> And I answered and said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Simon Kantheros here, my kinsman, summoned me to the
        meeting, saying that any member of the Sanhedrim could
        attend.”</span> The High Priest thought for a moment—he seemed as if
        he were counting us again—then he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Be
        it so; thou art at least a true son of Israel, and this is not a
        formal meeting of the priests.”</span> He sat him down again, and we
        waited. At last an attendant entered by the same door, and, going up
        to the High Priest, spake to him. He nodded quickly, and dismissed
        him with a wave of his hand. And when he had passed through the door,
        Hanan the High Priest rose, and spake to us these words:—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Kinsmen and colleagues, ye have all <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page176">[pg 176]</span><a name="Pg176" id="Pg176"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>heard, if ye have not witnessed, how Jesus
        of Nazara entered the Holy City on the first day of this week, amid
        the acclamations of his followers and many of the lower people, who
        even went so far as to hail him as the Deliverer. Now, to-morrow, as
        ye know, is the Passover. Who knows, if the thoughts of deliverance
        from Egypt, which come at that time, may not cause this man, or, if
        not him, his followers, to attempt a rising against the Romans our
        masters? We know that any such attempt would be entirely futile, but
        the very attempt itself would be the ruin of the nation. Ye know the
        character of the man Pontius Pilate. ’Tis but a short time since he
        slew, of wanton cruelty, certain Galilæans, even while they were
        making sacrifices, and all for mere suspicion of disaffection. Ye
        cannot but remember the building of Solomon’s Aqueduct. Because money
        was taken from the Temple treasury for the building thereof, the
        people were inflamed, and would have risen against them. What did he
        but send his soldiers, disguised in civil garb and armed with clubs,
        among the people, when they came to make their pro<span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page177">[pg 177]</span><a name="Pg177" id="Pg177"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>test? And without warning, and in mere
        wanton cruelty, did he give the signal for massacre. If he did this
        at a mere threat of a rising, what will happen should an actual
        rising take place to-morrow? It is our duty to see that such a
        calamity fall not upon this nation because of the presence of this
        rude provincial in our midst. Better one man should die than the
        nation should suffer. No time was to be lost, and I therefore have
        had this Jesus arrested, and he now awaits our pleasure in the
        atrium.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Before I summon him to our presence, I would briefly
        state to you what seems to me and some of our friends here the right
        course to be followed. We purpose to hand him over at dawn to Pontius
        Pilate, to deal with him as he will. For he, by his spies, and by the
        demonstration on the first day of the week, must be aware of the
        danger of a rising to-morrow night, caused by this man’s presence in
        our city. Indeed, it is for the very purpose of preventing a rising
        that he cometh up each year about the Passover to Jerusalem. Let it,
        then, be his care to prevent it how <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        "tei tei-anchor"></a>he will; we shall have done our part, and he
        cannot punish the nation, or us its leaders.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“But some of you will say, Why should we deliver this man
        up to the Romans, perhaps, or even probably, to his death? I say,
        that even apart from the danger which he offers to the State, he is
        worthy of death for his manifest blasphemies. He speaketh of himself
        as very God, and claims to be the Anointed One, and puts aside the
        Law as it pleaseth him. I say naught of his insolence in the Temple
        cloisters, for this matter concerns us that be priests, and in the
        matter of judgment we must not take account of aught that deals with
        our private concerns; yet it is manifest that he hath no reverence
        for the Lord’s house: witnesses shall prove to you that he hath said
        he would sweep it away and build another. I wonder not that horror is
        expressed in your faces at this blasphemy.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Yet, as ye know, our Law hath in mercy provided that
        none shall be condemned unless on the testimony of witnesses. The Law
        shall be fulfilled. Even <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page179">[pg
        179]</span><a name="Pg179" id="Pg179" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>now,
        as I speak, one of his followers, Judas, a man of Kerioth, is drawing
        forth from him his blasphemies before two witnesses, concealed, as is
        the custom. And even if he fail, I know this man Jesus; in his
        arrogance he will not scruple to repeat his blasphemies, even before
        us.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Time presses, and I have but this to add before the
        prisoner is summoned: it is a wise provision of our Law, that in
        capital charges no final condemnation shall occur until the second
        day of the trial. The day before the Passover began this eve. If we
        keep to the Law, no condemnation can take place till after the first
        day of the Passover, by which time all the mischance may have come to
        pass. If the power of life and death were solely in our hands, I
        would not depart in aught from the wise provision of our forefathers;
        but, in truth, if this man be put to death, it will not be our doing,
        for his fate rests with Pilate. I would remind the younger members of
        the Sanhedrim that the final decision is not with us, and if they
        vote for this man’s death, as I cannot doubt they will, considering
        the pressing danger <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page180">[pg
        180]</span><a name="Pg180" id="Pg180" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to
        our nation, they need not fear to be called members of a bloodthirsty
        Sanhedrim, since his death, if death he suffers, will be at the hands
        of the Roman Procurator. In this strait I propose, therefore, to
        examine this man at once, and if, as I doubt not, he avows his guilt,
        to wait till the morning for his final condemnation, and in this way
        fulfil the Law. Summon the prisoner to our presence.”</span> Then,
        turning to Caiaphas, he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“This is a
        matter between us and the Romans, for whom thou, Joseph, art the High
        Priest. Take thou, then, the interrogatory.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then from the
        lower end of the hall entered Jesus the Nazarene, with his arms bound
        with withes behind his back, and he was led by the captain of the
        guard up to the centre of the table opposite Caiaphas the High
        Priest. Then Caiaphas rose, and, looking at a paper in his hand which
        Hanan had given him, said unto Jesus, <span class="tei tei-q">“Jesus
        of Nazara, thou art accused before us of blasphemy, and of leading
        the people of Israel astray: what sayest thou thereto?”</span> Jesus
        gazed haughtily at him, and answered, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">I</span></span> spake openly to all the world, I
        have taught in the synagogue and in the Temple, and in secret I have
        said nothing. Why askest thou me? Ask them which heard me what I have
        said unto them. Behold, they know what I have said.”</span> Then one
        of the men who had led Jesus in struck him with the palm of his hand,
        and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Answerest thou the High Priest
        so?”</span> But Jesus <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page184">[pg
        184]</span><a name="Pg184" id="Pg184" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>turned, and said to him in a milder voice,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“If I have said aught that is evil, bear
        witness thereof; but if well, why smitest thou me?”</span> And
        Caiaphas the High Priest bade the man begone and bring in the
        witnesses. Then one man came forward and said he had heard Jesus call
        himself the Son of God. And another, that he had spoken of himself as
        if he were very God, and could do all that the Holy One, blessed be
        He, can perform. And yet another came forward and said he had heard
        Jesus speak of himself as Son of Man, and had thereby, as he thought,
        claimed to do what the Son of Man is said to do in the Prophets
        Daniel and Enoch. But no two of these witnesses agreed as to time and
        seasons, as is required by our Law. At last, however, two of them
        declared that on the preceding day in the Temple they had heard him
        say, <span class="tei tei-q">“I will destroy this Temple that is made
        with hands, and in three days I will build another without
        hands.”</span> Now, during all this time Jesus had said naught, but
        looked before him with that rapt expression that I had seen upon him
        on the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page185">[pg 185]</span><a name=
        "Pg185" id="Pg185" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>second occasion when I
        had heard him preach in the synagogue of the Galilæans. So Caiaphas
        the High Priest spake to him, saying, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Answerest thou naught to what these men witness against
        thee?”</span> And Jesus made as if he heard not.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Hanan the
        High Priest leaned over to Caiaphas his son-in-law and spake some
        words to him. Then Caiaphas, rising, spake thus to Jesus:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Holy
        One, blessed be He?”</span> Then Jesus raised his head, and gazing
        fixedly at the High Priest, said in a loud voice, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Thou hast said. And hereafter ye shall see the Son of
        Man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming on the clouds of
        heaven.”</span> Then Hanan the High Priest rose and rent his clothes,
        as is our wont in time of mourning or when blasphemy is heard, and he
        called out in his keen, shrill voice, <span class="tei tei-q">“What
        need we any further witnesses? Ye have heard the blasphemy; what
        think ye?”</span> And he waved his hand to the captain of the guard,
        who removed the prisoner.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the door was
        closed behind him, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page186">[pg
        186]</span><a name="Pg186" id="Pg186" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>Hanan said, <span class="tei tei-q">“What need
        we of further words? let us proceed to the judgment.”</span> And
        glancing over to Chananyah ben Nedebai, he said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Chananyah, thou art the youngest; it is thine to
        pronounce judgment first. Is not this man guilty of death for his
        manifest blasphemy here before us?”</span> And Chananyah said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Yea.”</span> And so said all till Hanan had
        called upon thirteen to give judgment. Then said Hanan, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“This man is for certain condemned to death, or at least
        to be handed over to the Roman Procurator: for already a majority of
        two have declared his death, even if all the rest were for an
        acquittal, as I cannot think possible. The Court will rise and
        reassemble at the time of the saying of the morning prayer, in order
        to confirm this judgment. Ye will not have long to wait, for even now
        I heard the crowing of the cock, and the dawn cannot be far
        off.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then the Court
        broke up, and many of the younger members met together and discussed
        the case. And I was somewhat surprised to find that very few words of
        compassion were raised for Jesus. The <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page187">[pg 187]</span><a name="Pg187" id="Pg187" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>stubborn conduct of the prisoner had set them
        against him in the first place, and his wild outburst had confirmed
        their ill thoughts of him. But most of all they were influenced by
        the thought that this was but a preliminary trial, and could only
        result in handing him over to the Roman Procurator, with whom the
        last word would be. None of them had seen aught of Jesus but during
        the last few days in the Temple, when he had interfered with their
        order and prerogatives. I cannot say I was convinced, either by
        Hanan’s harangue at first, or by these men’s arguments afterwards.
        But I was somewhat perplexed, feeling myself in some wise an intruder
        in their midst, not being of the priestly order. And as is my custom
        in such cases, I went out into the open air down the steps into the
        atrium.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There I found a
        great fire had been lit in the court, for the night was chilly. Near
        the fire Jesus was seated, with the High Priest’s guard around him.
        As I came near, behold, one of the guard threw part of his mantle
        across the face of Jesus so as to blindfold him, and then struck him,
        say<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page188">[pg 188]</span><a name=
        "Pg188" id="Pg188" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ing, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Thou art a Prophet; prophesy who hath struck
        thee.”</span> And all the soldiers laughed and jeered. Then sought I
        the captain of the guard and told him this, and he said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“They mean naught of ill—they be rude fellows; howbeit, I
        will stop them.”</span> And he went up to them and reproved them. And
        I paced up and down the courtyard, with the silent stars above and
        the glowing fire beneath, till an apparitor of the High Priest
        summoned me, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“It beginneth to dawn at
        the back of the house; the Council will resume its
        sitting.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When I entered the
        council-chamber, I found all seated as before, but in the midst was a
        smaller table, at which was seated a scribe, with a roll in front of
        him. Then Hanan the High Priest came in, and said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Ye have all had the time of deliberation prescribed by
        our sages in capital cases, or at least as much time as the urgency
        of the matter permits. We must proceed to the formal ratification of
        this man’s sentence, for I cannot doubt that ye will see fit to
        confirm the righteous judgment which your zeal for the Lord caused
        you to pass just now upon this man. And again I would <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page189">[pg 189]</span><a name="Pg189" id="Pg189"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>bid you remember you are voting, not so
        much for this man’s death, as whether he is to be delivered to the
        Romans. Scribe, read the roll.”</span> And with that the scribe began
        to read our names, and we all answered to them. Then said Hanan,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“We will now proceed to the voting,”</span>
        and called upon Chananyah ben Nedebai to record his vote. And he
        voted as before, for death. Then each in his turn, and all voted as
        before. And when my name was called upon I arose and hesitated, and
        Hanan looked over to me and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou
        speakest here by our courtesy, Meshullam ben Zadok; if thou disagree
        with the unanimous opinion of thy colleagues, thou hadst best
        instruct us in thy reasons. What sayest thou? Is not he guilty of
        death who is guilty of blasphemy against the Most High?”</span>
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Yea,”</span> said I. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And was not this man Jesus manifestly guilty of
        blasphemy before us?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Yea,”</span>
        said I. Then said Hanan swiftly to the scribe, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“He voteth for death,”</span> and waved me down to my
        seat. And thereafter all the remaining members of the Council voted
        for death, finishing with Hanan as the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page190">[pg 190]</span><a name="Pg190" id="Pg190" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>oldest, who merely gave a grim nod to the
        scribe.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By this time it
        was quite light, and all the Council and many of Hanan’s household
        joined together to say the morning prayers. After prayers most of the
        Council, with Hanan and Caiaphas at our head, followed the soldiers
        who guarded Jesus down from the Mount of Olives. As we came near the
        Brook Kidron, behold, a man with haggard face darted out from the
        shrubs by the wayside, and rushing up to Hanan the High Priest,
        dashed down at his feet a bag which chinked, and then disappeared
        into the wayside again. But Hanan only motioned with his finger to
        the bag at his feet, and the captain of his guard lifted it up and
        poured out its contents into his hand, and, behold, it was a number
        of new shekels from the Temple treasury. Then Hanan smiled grimly,
        and bade the captain put them aside. Thereupon we resumed our march,
        and soon came to the Aldgate. There we inquired where the Procurator
        was, and learnt that he had taken up his dwelling at the Palace of
        Herod, so that he might be in Jerusalem <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page191">[pg 191]</span><a name="Pg191" id="Pg191" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>during the Passover, as was his wont, for fear
        of a rising at that time. Then we marched across and halted in front
        of the palace. And on our way the rumor spread throughout the city
        that Jesus the Nazarene was being carried before the Procurator, and
        soon our procession was joined by all who were free from household
        duties. I have explained to thee, have I not, how that for those of
        the older opinion this sixth day of the week was the day on which the
        Paschal lamb was to be sacrificed, and for all good Jews the morning
        would be devoted to the final search after the leaven. That morning,
        therefore, all the householders of Jerusalem and all the heads of
        families were occupied in the search after leaven, or in preparation
        for the Paschal sacrifice, and it was only the younger men, and those
        who cared not for acts of piety, who followed our procession on the
        way to Herod’s Palace.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, all those of
        the Council were of the older opinion as to the Paschal sacrifice,
        and were about to perform it on the evening of that day. Wherefore it
        behoved them not to enter the dwellings of <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page192">[pg 192]</span><a name="Pg192" id="Pg192" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>the heathen during that day, since it is their
        custom to bury the bodies of men in their gardens or in their houses,
        which render them a defilement to us Jews. Therefore on the day of a
        sacrifice no Jew may enter a heathen’s house, above all the High
        Priest, upon whose sanctity the holiness of the nation depends. When,
        therefore, we came within twenty paces of the Procurator’s dwelling,
        Hanan caused our procession to halt, and a summons to be sounded upon
        the trumpet. Thereat a lictor appeared, who asked our business, and
        to him Hanan gave a message to the Procurator. And here for the first
        time since he had been arrested I could see the countenance of Jesus
        near me, and it surprised me much to observe that all traces of
        anxiety and weariness had disappeared from it. He seemed relieved and
        resigned, and paid no heed to what was passing around him, seeming
        only to commune with himself, or perhaps, I should say, with some
        inward friend and comforter.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Pontius
        Pilate came forward and spake to Joseph Caiaphas the High Priest, and
        asked him what he would with him. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page193">[pg 193]</span><a name="Pg193" id="Pg193" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>And Caiaphas answered and said, pointing to
        Jesus, <span class="tei tei-q">“This man have we captured and brought
        unto thee, finding that he was perverting the people, and declaring
        that he was the Anointed One of Israel, and therefore the rightful
        King of the Jews. Him therefore have we brought to thee, seeing it is
        a matter which toucheth our master the Emperor.”</span> Thereupon
        Pontius Pilate turned round, and said something in the barbarian
        tongue, and the guard of Roman soldiers came forward and took Jesus
        from the High Priest’s guard, and took him with them up the steps of
        the palace. Then Pilate courteously invited the High Priests to enter
        the judgment-hall with him; but they, in answer, pointed out that on
        that holy day they dared not enter to any house but their own and the
        house of God. Then Pilate turned his back with scanter courtesy, and
        reëntered the palace, and we and the common people remained outside
        waiting.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page194">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And after a while
        of waiting, Pontius Pilate reappeared, and coming down to Caiaphas
        said, <span class="tei tei-q">“He hath confessed; he shall join the
        other criminals that are to be executed this day.”</span> Then one
        among those who were waiting in the crowd came forward unto Pilate,
        and said unto him, <span class="tei tei-q">“Master, it is a grace of
        our lord the Emperor that at our Passover there be released unto us
        one of the prisoners that are condemned to death.”</span> And Pilate
        answered and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“That is so: whom will ye
        that I release?”</span> And many of those in the crowd called out,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Jesus.”</span> And Pilate stepped back, and
        summoned to him a lictor. And shortly after soldiers came forward in
        the portico, bearing with them Jesus the Nazarene. Upon him was a
        purple robe of royalty, and upon his brow had been placed the faded
        rose-wreath of some reveller which had been put on in haste, and some
        of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg 198]</span><a name=
        "Pg198" id="Pg198" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>thorns had torn the
        flesh, and blood was trickling down. When the people saw him, many
        cried out, <span class="tei tei-q">“Not this Jesus, but Jesus Bar
        Abbas.”</span> And one man among the crowd called out, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Better Jesus Bar Abba<a id="noteref_10" name=

        laughter and jeers followed. Then Pilate seemed puzzled, and called
        to him one of his lictors, who spake earnestly to him for a time, and
        then received an order from him. And going up the steps, he entered
        the palace. And shortly afterwards there came forward the man Jesus
        Bar Abbas of Jerusalem, of whom I have spoken to thee before. Now, he
        had been very popular among the folk, and had lost his liberty in a
        rising against the Romans, in which a Roman sentry had been slain.
        And there stood the two Jesuses—the one that had risen against the
        Romans, and the one that had told the people they should pay tribute
        to their Roman lords. It was manifest that the new-comer, who had
        done naught against the Romans, was more in favor with Pilate the
        Procurator, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page199">[pg
        199]</span><a name="Pg199" id="Pg199" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>while the folk who had welcomed him on the first
        day of the week, on this the sixth day reviled and despised him
        because he had refused to lead a rising against the Romans as the
        other one had done. Then Pilate called out to them and said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Whom will ye that I release unto you: Jesus
        who is called Bar Abbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?”</span> And
        almost all the multitude cried, <span class="tei tei-q">“Jesus Bar
        Abbas! Jesus Bar Abbas!”</span> Then Pilate gave command, and the
        soldiers took tack Jesus the Nazarene into the palace again, while
        others removed the fetters from Jesus Bar Abbas, and he came down the
        steps and disappeared among the crowd.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After a while,
        there came forward from the side gate a company of Roman soldiers,
        who took their stand in front of the steps of the palace, moving the
        crowd away therefrom. And shortly after, other soldiers brought down
        from above three men, each carrying two pieces of timber, one fixed
        across the top of the other, like unto the letter <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">tau</span></span>.
        One of these was Jesus the Nazarene, clad once more in his own
        garments, and without the rose-<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page200">[pg 200]</span><a name="Pg200" id="Pg200" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>wreath; yet couldst thou see the mark of the
        thorns upon his brow. The others were, as I learnt, malefactors that
        had been condemned for robbery.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Just at this
        moment one touched me on the shoulder, and, turning, I found it was
        one of the servants of my household, who spake unto me and said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Meshullam ben Zadok, thy father would speak
        with thee.”</span> And as the house was not far off, I went with him
        and spake to my father, who would have me accompany him on the search
        for leaven on that morn. For at that time I was betrothed, and next
        year I should have a house of my own, and would have to conduct the
        search for leaven as a master of a household. So I went round the
        house with my father—peace be upon him!—and searched for the
        leaven.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By the time the
        search for the leaven had been concluded, the hour had come for the
        mid-day meal, at which all the members of my family assembled. But I
        hurried forth, as soon as the grace after meals had been said, to
        ascertain what had been the fate of the Nazarene. I <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page201">[pg 201]</span><a name="Pg201" id="Pg201"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>could not go to the place of execution,
        for it is not seemly for a member of the Sanhedrim to attend an
        execution. I soon learnt that the Roman soldiers had conducted Jesus
        and the two others to the Hill Golgotha, somewhat apart from the
        place of stoning, where our Jewish executions were held.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As I have
        explained to thee, Aglaophonos, our Sages have mercifully interpreted
        the words of the Law relating to the four modes of capital punishment
        among us—stoning, burning, beheading, and strangulation. For stoning
        they have substituted throwing down from a height after the criminal
        has been made to feel naught by drinking a mixture of frankincense,
        myrrh, and vinegar, which the ladies of Jerusalem supply as one of
        their pious duties. The criminal condemned to be burnt is in reality
        strangled, and then a lighted wick placed for a moment in his open
        mouth. In every way the aim of the Sages is to shorten the sufferings
        of the condemned man. But the Romans, at least in their execution of
        all but Roman citizens, seem rather to aim at <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page202">[pg 202]</span><a name="Pg202" id="Pg202"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the opposite of this; for they have
        selected, as their method of execution for slaves and criminals that
        are not citizens, suspension on a cross, by which all the organs of
        the body are strained and tortured till some vital organ gives way.
        It was this cruel form of punishment that the Romans were dealing out
        to Jesus the Nazarene. It happeneth oft that men live for two or
        three days on the cross, till they die even of hunger. I learnt to my
        dismay that Jesus had refused, with words of menace, to take the
        draught of myrrh and wine which the ladies of Jerusalem, as I have
        said, prepare for all men condemned to capital punishment, so that
        they may not feel the pain and torture.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I could not go to
        the place of execution, as a member of the Sanhedrim. I hurried,
        therefore, to the northern slopes of the Temple mount, whence one can
        see Golgotha. At first I could discern naught, for sombre clouds
        covered all the heights of Scopus. But suddenly a flash came forth
        from them, followed by a dull roll of thunder, and I could see for a
        moment three crosses raised side by side on the <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page203">[pg 203]</span><a name="Pg203" id="Pg203"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>top of Golgotha. Which of these held Jesus
        I knew not. I only knew that there was dying one who had seemed born
        to do honor to his nation, to help to deliver Israel from the men who
        were now torturing him to his death. Since the night before, events
        had so hurried past me that I had had no time to think of their
        import till now, when I sat me down in the purple shadow of Antonia,
        and gazed upon the hill of execution, where from time to time flashes
        showed me the three crosses on the hill.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This, then, was
        the end of the hopes connected with Jesus of Nazara, and of the
        empire which he had wielded over men’s minds! But five days agone
        welcomed as a king, to-day executed with the ignominy reserved for
        the basest slave. Each day of his sojourn in Jerusalem he had made
        another and yet another class of the nation his enemies. First he
        threatens the power of the priests; next he insults their opposites,
        the Pharisees; and then he puts to naught the hope of the common folk
        that he would help them rise against the Romans. Between Sabbath and
        Sab<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page204">[pg 204]</span><a name=
        "Pg204" id="Pg204" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>bath he had lost every
        friend; not even his immediate followers stood by his side in the
        hour of trial.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And yet no man had
        appeared in Israel for many generations endowed in so high a degree
        with all the qualities which mark us Israelites out from the nations
        around. He was tender to the poor; and which of the nations has given
        thought for its poor, their feelings as well as their welfare, like
        unto Israel? He bare the yoke of the Law willingly, yet as a son, not
        as a slave, of the Most High. God was to him, as to all of us, as an
        ever-present Father, to love, to chasten, and to reward; not as a
        harsh taskmaster or as a boon-companion, as with the commoner minds
        of thy people, Aglaophonos; nor as a vain figment of the reason, as
        with thy higher minds.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Even in what thou
        regardest as defects in our nation, this Jesus seemed also to share.
        Thou makest us the reproach that we give no thought to the beauties
        and grandeur of nature, and in nothing that I had seen and heard of
        him did the Nazarene differ from the rest of us in this. Thou
        complainest that we look upon life <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page205">[pg 205]</span><a name="Pg205" id="Pg205" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>with all too much seriousness. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Ye cannot see the smile upon the face of things,”</span>
        thou saidst once to me. In this surely Jesus was a Jew of the Jews.
        We never saw him smile, still less heard him laugh. Thou wouldst hold
        up to me as a model Socrates thy teacher, who taught the Hellenes
        truth with a smile. That man there, dying upon the cross, had tried
        to teach Israel the truth with tears and threats.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Herein he followed
        the exemplar of our prophets. Only in Israel have the men who have
        led us farthest reviled us most. As our God, who has been to us a
        Father, has chastened us while he loved us, so our prophets have
        rebuked us their brethren. Many generations of men have passed since
        the last of the prophets spake his words of loving reproof. Now has
        appeared this Jesus, who again takes up their work.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But in one thing,
        and that a great thing, he differs from our prophets. All these spake
        never but as messengers of the Most High. This man alone of the
        prophets speaketh in his own name: therefore he hath been a
        stumbling-block and an of<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page206">[pg
        206]</span><a name="Pg206" id="Pg206" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>fence unto us. He spake as one having authority,
        and it seemed to us as arrogance. And when we would speak with him in
        the gates, and know his own thought, he evaded our questionings and
        eluded our testings. He seemed aloof from us and our desires. All
        Israel was pining to be freed from the Roman yoke, and he would have
        us pay tribute to Rome for aye. Did he feel himself in some way as
        not of our nation? I know not; but in all ways we failed to know
        him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And as I was
        communing thus, the sun shone forth from a rift in the clouds and
        illumined for a space the crown of Calvary, and I stretched forth my
        hands to the figures on the cross, and cried aloud in my perplexity,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Jesus, what art thou?”</span> And then I
        bethought me, and my hands fell to my side, and I said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What wert thou, Jesus?”</span> Naught answered me but
        the distant rumbling from the gloomy clouds.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the sun was
        setting over Israel, and I turned to my father’s house, there once
        more to celebrate the Feast of the Deliverance from Egypt.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus far had I
        written to thee, Aglaophonos, as to what I knew of that Jesus the
        Nazarene about whom thou hast made so earnest inquiry. I had minded
        to hand it to Alphæus ben Simon, my cousin, who goeth this week in
        the galley to Cyprus, and thence would have passed it on to thee by
        the hands of one of our brethren who visit Greece from year to year.
        But there has happened to me an event which has given me much to
        think of with regard to this very matter of Jesus. It chanced that
        the day before yesterday I went from the Jewish quarter in this city
        of Alexandria for my usual walk along the Lochias, which adjoins it.
        There it is my custom to catch the sea air and to watch the vessels
        put into the Inner Port. Now, it chanced that as I came upon the
        Lochias, the vessel of Joppa had just hoved-to in the Inner Port, and
        the passengers were being landed up the Broad Steps. Now <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page208">[pg 208]</span><a name="Pg208" id="Pg208"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>these, by their <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">talith</span></span> and their faces, I knew to
        be Jews, and I went up to them, and greeted them with the greeting of
        peace. But among them one came to me with the look of recognition in
        his eyes, and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Knowest thou me not,
        Meshullam ben Zadok?”</span> And, behold, it was Rufus ben Simon,
        whom I had known before I left the Holy City. So I welcomed him, and
        brought him home to this house of mine. And here he remaineth till
        the morrow, when he starteth forth to go to Cyrene.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, in my
        inquiries about old friends left behind, and new things that had
        happened since I went away, I failed not to ask about the followers
        of the Nazarene. To my wonder, I found that this Rufus had become one
        of them, even though he was but a child when Jesus died. Yet is he a
        good Jew in all else. He eateth only our meat, and keepeth our
        Sabbaths and festivals. But he avers that the Anointed One, whom we
        expect, has already appeared, and that he was Jesus the Nazarene. And
        upon my inquiry how he could know aught of Jesus but from the common
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page209">[pg 209]</span><a name="Pg209"
        id="Pg209" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>talk, he put in my hand some
        Memorabilia of him, written down in Hebrew by one of his chief
        followers, Matathias.<a id="noteref_12" name="noteref_12" href=
        "#note_12"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        have I read again and again, and pondered much thereon. Nor have I
        been able to sleep these two nights for the new thoughts about Jesus
        that have come to me from reading these memoirs of him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For, behold, he
        appeareth in these records of him by his own followers in far other
        wise than he showed himself to us in public at Jerusalem. In all his
        public acts among us he was full of scornful rebukes; among his own
        followers he was tender and loving. Scarcely ever could we get him to
        speak out to us plainly his views about matters of public concern. He
        would always give us an answer full of evasion and enigma, but to his
        followers he would explain all his meaning over and over again,
        illustrated with parable. There at Jerusalem he almost always turned
        to the people his harsher side. I saw him on every occasion on which
        he appeared in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page210">[pg
        210]</span><a name="Pg210" id="Pg210" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>public in Jerusalem, and, save only in his
        sermons, he was always rebuking one or another, just like the
        prophets of old. And the manner of his rebuking towards us was as
        with scorpions, whereas among his own he would mingle tenderness even
        with his reproaches. Nor, saving his sermons, which few heard but
        those who already followed him, had he aught novel to tell us about
        the things of life. He seemed to us as if he would destroy the temple
        of our faith, nor in his public actions did he give any promise of
        building it up anew. Yet to those with him he would continually be
        telling what to do and how to do it, till, behold, a new manner of
        life, fair and seemly, stood before them, fulfilled of Jewish
        righteousness, with a tender mercy which was the man’s very own.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I need not detail
        to thee, Aglaophonos, what these acts and words were which have given
        me an altogether new light as to the character and thoughts of the
        man Jesus. From certain words of thine in thy letter, which I
        understood not then when I first read it, I can see now that thou
        must have had some such account of the life and <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg 211]</span><a name="Pg211" id="Pg211"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>death of Jesus before thee as this which
        Rufus hath shown unto me. Now I can understand wherefore thou hast
        inquired about this Jesus with such eager insistence. And to thee as
        a Gentile the revelation of his character would come with more
        attractive force than to us that be Jews. For in almost every way
        this Jesus fulfilleth the idea of a Jew as we have it in these later
        days. Working with his hands, yet teaching with his voice; obedient
        to the Law, yet ever eager to take a new law upon himself; doing acts
        of love among men, yet rebuking in love their ill acts, and doing all
        things as in the presence of the Glory;—in all this Jesus was as the
        best of our Sages.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Wherefore, then, did ye suffer him to be killed?”</span>
        thou wilt ask me, and indeed I ask myself. If I were to answer thee
        in the way Jesus was wont to answer us, I would say, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Why did ye Hellenes condemn Socrates to the
        hemlock?”</span> For he was as much the Ideal of the Hellenes as
        Jesus of the Jews. Every Hellene would be eloquent and reasonable,
        and that was Socrates. Every Jew would be wise and <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page212">[pg 212]</span><a name="Pg212" id="Pg212"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>good and pious, and that was Jesus. Yet
        each of these men, if I read their lives aright, died the death of a
        criminal, because he cared not for that which his fellow-countrymen
        cared for most. Socrates died because he would force his countrymen
        to examine by their reason the ideas and ideals which they all
        accepted. Jesus died for the same reason, but also for another—for
        that he cared naught for our national hopes. We were all panting for
        national freedom; he would have naught of it. Whether it was that he
        felt in some sort to be not of our nation, I know not; but in all his
        teaching he dealt with us as men, not as Jews. It is this, I can see,
        that has attracted thee to his doctrine, whereas thou wert always
        scornful of our Jewish pretensions, as thou calledst them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet herein again
        was he at one with the best thoughts of our Sages. Our God is the God
        of all, and his Law shall be one day the Law of all. If we yearn for
        the universal realm of the Messiah, it is as much for the sake of the
        world as for ourselves. But methinks I see in the thoughts of this
        Jesus an idea quite other than ours <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page213">[pg 213]</span><a name="Pg213" id="Pg213" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>as to what the Anointed One shall be and shall
        do. We hope for him as a Deliverer and a Conqueror with force of arms
        by God’s aid. Now, Jesus seemed not to think of the Anointed One in
        any way like this. His mind seemed to be filled rather with the
        picture of the Servant of God as drawn by the Prophet Esaias. Thou
        knowest the passage, Aglaophonos; I remember thy laughter when first
        I read it thee, that men could look forward to contempt and hatred as
        a good. Truly the idea is far different from the saying of the
        barbarian, <span class="tei tei-q">“Woe to the conquered!”</span> And
        surely to us all, Jew and Gentile, Greek and barbarian, the greatest
        of joys is this—to worst an equal foe in fair fight. But to Esaias
        the prophet, and to Jesus the Nazarene after him, the higher victory
        is with him that is worsted in the battle of life. That will come as
        good tidings to nine out of every ten of men.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Therefore, if
        Jesus thought of himself as the Anointed One, it was as being
        anointed with the woes of the vanquished, with the sweat and the
        blood of the lowly and despised. Now I know why he seemed so
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page214">[pg 214]</span><a name="Pg214"
        id="Pg214" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>sad when he was greeted at
        Jerusalem as a victor. He had spent his life in trying to impress a
        new ideal upon his people, and they had welcomed him only as the
        fulfilment of the old ideal which he desired to replace. None of thy
        poets have given a drama with more of <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">eironeia</span></span> in it than this.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet why did he
        remain silent before us as to these ideas of his? If, indeed, these
        were his ideas; for even with the new light given by the Hebrew
        Memorabilia, I can see his thought but dimly. Why spake he not his
        own thought to the people in Jerusalem, and tell us no longer to hope
        for worldly dominion as the best means for spreading the Law of the
        Lord, but rather to be as servants of God, even as Esaias the Prophet
        hath spoken? Was it that he wished to carry out the description of
        the prophet even to every iota of his text? For, behold, the prophet
        sayeth, <span class="tei tei-q">“He let himself be humbled, and
        opened not his mouth.”</span> If so, then was the death of Jesus but
        a sublime suicide.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For surely by this
        silence he has committed a grievous sin against us his people.
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page215">[pg 215]</span><a name="Pg215"
        id="Pg215" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>For if we committed aught of
        sin and crime that handed him over to the Romans as a pretender to
        empire, he indeed shared our sin and crime by his silence. Ye
        Hellenes were at least greater in fault than we in the matter of
        Socrates; for ye condemned him after he had spoken his whole mind and
        made known his whole thought to his people; whereas we condemned one
        who, I make bold to say, was even greater than thy Socrates, mainly
        because of what seemed to us his sullen and arrogant silence, broken
        only by a confession of guilt when he knew he was not guilty.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But yet, let me
        not be as harsh in judgment upon him after his death, as perhaps I
        was when I allowed the sentence to be declared against him without
        protest. He, least of all men, could have died with a lie upon his
        lips. In some sort and in some way he must have combined the thought
        of the triumphant Messiah and of the despised Servant of God. For in
        those Memorabilia of him which have come into my hands during the
        last days as being a message from him that is dead, I find
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page216">[pg 216]</span><a name="Pg216"
        id="Pg216" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>these two things combined. He
        speaketh ever of the blessedness of the poor and the humble and the
        despised, even as the Ebionim speak. So that if a man would be
        blessed, he would choose a lowly career, even as did Jesus. Yet
        withal he speaketh oft of himself as the Son of Man, and every Jew
        that heard him would think he knew what he thereby claimed. For in
        the Prophets Daniel and Enoch it is clearly said that the Son of Man
        would come in victory over the world; and what other could this
        universal victor be than the Anointed One whom the prophets had
        foretold? If Jesus put another meaning upon the prophetic words, why
        spake he not his meaning fully unto the people? All we may have gone
        like sheep astray, but he that might have been our shepherd went
        apart alone with God.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">O Jesus, why didst
        thou not show thyself to thy people in thy true character? Why didst
        thou seem to care not for aught that we at Jerusalem cared for? Why,
        arraigned before the appointed judges of thy people, didst thou keep
        silence before <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page217">[pg
        217]</span><a name="Pg217" id="Pg217" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>us,
        and, by thus keeping silent, share in pronouncing judgment upon
        thyself? We have slain thee as the Hellenes have slain Socrates their
        greatest, and our punishment will be as theirs. Then will Israel be
        even as thou wert, despised and rejected of men—a nation of sorrows
        among the nations. But Israel is greater than any of his sons, and
        the day will come when he will know thee as his greatest. And in that
        day he will say unto thee, <span class="tei tei-q">“My sons have
        slain thee, O my son, and thou hast shared our
        guilt.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page218">[pg

              the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</span></h2>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project
              Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
              public support and donations to carry out its mission of
              increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that
              can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible
              by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
              Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important
              to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
              Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
              charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the
              United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it
              takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
              meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
              donations in locations where we have not received written
              confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the
              status of compliance for any particular state visit <a href=
              "http://www.gutenberg.org/donate" class=
              "tei tei-xref">http://www.gutenberg.org/donate</a></p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While we
              cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
              have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no
              prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors
              in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
              International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot
              make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations
              received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp
              our small staff.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Please check
              the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods
              and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways
              including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

              originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of
              electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For
              thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™
              eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project
              Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
              editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by
              copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included.
              Thus, we do not necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any
              particular paper edition.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each ebook
              is in a subdirectory of the same number as the ebook's ebook
              number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
              compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</p>

              the old file and take over the old filename and etext number.
